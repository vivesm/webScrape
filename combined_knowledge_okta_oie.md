Okta FastPass

Okta FastPass

is a phishing-resistant, passwordless authenticator. It enables secure access to

Okta

-protected apps across all supported platforms on managed and unmanaged devices. To use

Okta FastPass

, users must install the latest version of the

Okta Verify

app and create an account on their desktops, laptops, or mobile devices.

Okta Verify

with

Okta FastPass

support is available for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.

Benefits

Phishing-resistant authentication

You can configure phishing-resistant constraints in your authentication policy rules. When users sign in to apps,

Okta FastPass

verifies that the authentication request doesn't come from a malicious site. You can also configure a phishing-resistant authenticator enrollment for your users.

Passwordless authentication

doesn't come from a malicious site. You can also configure a phishing-resistant authenticator enrollment for your users.

Passwordless authentication

Okta FastPass

uses public key cryptography to authenticate users. By eliminating the need for passwords,

Okta FastPass

provides user-friendly authentication while reducing the risk of security incidents and the IT costs associated with factor enrollment and reset.

Device posture evaluation

For increased security, you can use device assurance policies to configure access to resources based on device attributes such as operating system and screen lock. During authentication,

Okta FastPass

collects security signals from

Okta

and third-party sources and evaluates the device posture according to the device assurance policy rules. Compliant devices are granted access to resources. On non-compliant devices, users are denied access unless they complete remediation actions.

Consistent us

## Chunk 6: fp-main.htm_chunk_3

**Source**: fp-main.htm_chunk_3.json

nt devices are granted access to resources. On non-compliant devices, users are denied access unless they complete remediation actions.

Consistent user experience

Okta FastPass

works with OIDC, SAML, and WS-Federation apps protected by

Okta

. It integrates with built-in device authenticators such as Windows Hello, Touch ID, or Face ID to facilitate biometric authentication.

Okta FastPass

is supported on managed and unmanaged devices on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.

How it works

In the following example, users authenticate with

Okta FastPass

without providing a username or password.

The user initiates an authentication request by accessing an

Okta

-protected app.

The

Okta

server issues a unique challenge for the authentication request.

The

Sign-In Widget

on the browser or an OS-specific app forwards that challenge to

Okta Verify

with

Okta FastPass

enabled (installed on the same device).

**Source**: fp-main.htm_chunk_4.json

er or an OS-specific app forwards that challenge to

Okta Verify

with

Okta FastPass

enabled (installed on the same device).

Okta FastPass

collects device signals, generates a response, and signs it with the proof of possession private key that was issued during user enrollment.

Okta FastPass

sends the response to the server.

The

Okta

server validates the signature and confirms that the response corresponds to the unique challenge that was issued.

The

Okta

policies are evaluated based on the device context collected. If the policy conditions are met, the user is granted access to the app.

Okta Personal for Workforce

Okta Personal for Workforce is a set of features that integrates Okta's consumer password manager, Okta Personal, with your Workforce org. You can provide it as a free personal password manager for your users, and separate their personal data from your enterprise apps.

Benefits

Improved security standards

Decoupling personal and work apps prevents users' personal security habits from compromising org security standards.

Ease of adaptability

Users in your org can switch between their Okta work and personal accounts in the same user interface, while keeping their accounts separate.

Reduction in help desk tickets

Okta Personal for Workforce decreases the volume of support tickets that your help desk receives, because they don't have to triage personal app issu

## Chunk 10: get-started.htm_chunk_2

**Source**: get-started.htm_chunk_2.json


Okta Personal for Workforce decreases the volume of support tickets that your help desk receives, because they don't have to triage personal app issues.

Streamlined offboarding process

Your users maintain access to their saved apps even if they leave your org, because their personal apps are saved in the consumer password manager. By owning this account, users ensure that orgs don't have visibility into their personal apps.

How it works

Okta Personal allows users to see all of their apps in one place, securely store their passwords, and autofill credentials when they sign in to apps. If you choose to make Okta Personal available to your users, you can configure how your users interact with it.

Control app migration

Okta Personal for Workforce streamlines the app migration process for you, but you can use the feature without enabling app migration. If you choose to allow app migration, users can't migrate org-managed apps to their

r you, but you can use the feature without enabling app migration. If you choose to allow app migration, users can't migrate org-managed apps to their personal dashboard. You can also block email domains from migration.

Customize the messaging

Okta Personal for Workforce provides a set of interface updates that help your users understand app migration and eligibility. You can turn off these updates  if you don't allow app migration, or if you prefer to manage your own messaging about Okta Personal.

Monitor its use

The System Log records an event whenever users move apps from their Workforce account, so you can be sure that only personal apps are migrated.

Identity Governance

Use

Okta

Identity Governance (OIG) to ensure that your users only have the access they need and nothing more. It helps you manage user identity and access lifecycles across multiple systems to improve the overall security of your company.

Benefits

Adopt the least privileged access model

Create, protect, and audit access to critical resources to reduce risks associated with unmanaged identities.

Increase employee productivity

Automatically provision new employees to birthright apps and allow them to request access to additional resources.

Improve IT efficiency

Automate tasks to reduce the time and errors associated with manual data entry and provisioning tasks.

al data entry and provisioning tasks.

How it works

Okta Identity Governance consists of three Okta offerings: Lifecycle Management (LCM), Workflows, and Access Governance. Together these offerings can help you adopt the least privileged access model for your org.

LCM and Workflows simplify access fulfillment and entitlement tasks throughout a user's identity lifecycle. Lifecycle Management helps you manage users, groups (and group owners), apps, rules, assignments, and other attributes associated with these. You can tackle identity lifecycle processes, such as directory integration, profile mapping,

Okta Integration Network

connectors, SCIM integrations (including SCIM integrations with entitlements), On-Premise Provisioning (OPP), and partner integrations.

Okta Workflows

helps you build no-code or low-code flows for automating custom actions. You can also use OIG-specific System Log events to take custom actions using

**Source**: iga.htm_chunk_3.json

build no-code or low-code flows for automating custom actions. You can also use OIG-specific System Log events to take custom actions using

Okta Workflows

.

The two offerings work together with Access Governance to streamline the processes of requesting and reviewing access to groups, apps, app entitlements, and

Okta

admin roles.

Okta Access Governance consists of the following components.

Access Certifications

Use

Access Certifications

campaigns to periodically review your users' access to resources and approve or revoke access automatically based on the reviewer's decision. Running campaigns frequently can help ensure that users only retain the level of access that they need. Campaigns also help you meet your audit and compliance requirements or professional standards like SOC2 and SOX.

 and SOX.

Access Certifications

is extensible through

Okta Workflows

.

Access Requests

Access Requests

streamlines the process of requesting and approving access to resources like apps, app entitlements, and groups. You can create conditions or request types for resources so that only the users who need access can request access.

Users can request access to a resource directly from their End-User Dashboard. You can define how the request should be routed for approval and any actions, including custom actions through delegated flows that should be taken automatically as a result of approval or denial.

Entitlement Management

Use

Entitlement Management

to  import, create, and manage entitlements for various apps from the

Okta

Admin Console

. You can create entitlement policies to assign entitlements based on the user's profile attributes or assign entitlements individually to ensure that users have the right level of access 

---

## Chunk 17: iga.htm_chunk_5

**Source**: iga.htm_chunk_5.json

to assign entitlements based on the user's profile attributes or assign entitlements individually to ensure that users have the right level of access to their apps.

Resource Collections

Use Resource Collections to combine sets of apps and entitlements. You can directly assign resource collections to users.

Separation of duties

Use Separation of duties (SOD) rules to define which combinations of entitlements create conflicts of interest in an org. Divide tasks and responsibilities using these rules so that the same user in an org doesn't have control over all aspects of a critical process. You can configure SOD rules to help reduce the risk of error, fraud, or unauthorized actions. Use

Access Requests

and

Access Certifications

to control which combinations of entitlements users are allowed to request and possess.

Reports, APIs, and System Log events

Use Access Governance-specific reports to get an overview of past certification

## Chunk 18: iga.htm_chunk_6

allowed to request and possess.

Reports, APIs, and System Log events

Use Access Governance-specific reports to get an overview of past certification campaigns and details of past resource access requests and campaigns. The

Identity governance APIs

allow you to perform various tasks related to entitlements, access requests, campaigns, or reports. Additionally, you can use

Okta

Identity Governance-specific System Log events to take custom actions using

Okta Workflows

.

Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI

Identity-based attacks are a growing threat to organizations and their users. These attacks use techniques like phishing, session hijacking, and credential stuffing to compromise sensitive information about the people in your org. Protecting against these attacks requires a comprehensive security strategy.

Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI

(ITP) is a continuous identity threat solution that responds to threats as they happen. It combines your current identity security solutions (like ThreatInsight, Behavior Detection, risk-based authentication) to provide complete identity protection to your org.

o your org.

Identity Threat Protection

continuously evaluates users and their sessions, receiving risk signals through the Okta risk engine and through security events providers. When ITP identifies changes in a user's risk,

Network Zone

, device, or behavior,  it launches automated mitigation and remediation actions that you can configure according to your org's security requirements.

This constant and real-time risk assessment provides a Zero Trust approach to identity management security.

How it works

Without ITP,  your configured global session and authentication policy conditions are only evaluated for identity threats when a user signs in to an org. For all subsequent web requests, your authentication policy is evaluated against the app from which the request is received.

With ITP, these policies, and your

ITP also determines risk for org using signals from

and your integrated endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, ITP gets signals about device context, admin or user-reported risk changes, and IP threats detected by Okta.

. By receiving risk signals from security events providers, you can uncover more potential identity threats.

A security events provider is a third-party vendor that supports SSF and with whom Okta has partnered to exchange security-related events. You must be a customer of the security events provider to integrate them with Okta.

ITP provides an

Entity risk policy

that enables you to configure automatic actions in response to identified risks. You can customize this policy for different scenarios based on user group, risk level, and risk detections. If ITP uncovers a risk, your entity risk policy can run a delegated flow or terminate the user's access to apps that are configured for

Universal Logout

.

There are several ways that you can monitor

while it identifies and responds to identity-based security threats:

The user risk profile displays a risk level of low, medium, or high based on the user's login, session, and entity risk detections. It also displays the login, session, and entity risk detections for that user over the last seven days.

The Admin Dashboard has widgets for continuous access, entity risk detections, and at-risk users. These widgets provide an overview of your org's ITP events.

The System Log displays the details of all logged ITP events in your org.

Detailed reports provide comprehensive information about your org's risk detections.

This diagram shows how ITP works with
