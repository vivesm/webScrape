# WebScrape Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

WebScrape exists to solve the challenge of efficiently gathering and processing web content for use in AI and machine learning applications, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 

The project addresses the growing need to:
1. Quickly collect domain-specific information from websites
2. Transform that information into a format that LLMs can effectively utilize
3. Enable semantic search and retrieval of that information
4. Provide a customizable pipeline for web data collection to AI processing
5. Support multilingual content and cross-product documentation
6. Integrate with both local and cloud-based LLMs

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Content Acquisition Challenges
- **Manual data gathering is time-consuming**: WebScrape automates the collection of web content across multiple pages
- **Cookie banners and JavaScript elements block scraping**: The headless browser approach handles modern web elements
- **Website structure complexity**: Link extraction and content identification are handled automatically
- **Language-specific content**: Intelligent processing of multilingual content with language detection

### 2. RAG Data Preparation Difficulties
- **Raw text is unsuitable for RAG**: Content is automatically chunked into appropriate sizes for LLM context windows
- **Metadata loss in processing**: Source information, language, and context are preserved in the processed output
- **Time-consuming preprocessing**: The pipeline automates text extraction, cleaning, and chunking
- **Complex HTML structures**: Enhanced HTML parsing intelligently extracts meaningful content

### 3. Local LLM Integration
- **Complexity of embedding generation**: Seamless integration with Ollama simplifies vector embedding creation
- **Disconnected toolchains**: End-to-end pipeline from web content to LLM-ready data with embeddings
- **Resource constraints**: Efficient processing minimizes computational requirements
- **Timeout issues with large contexts**: Streaming response generation ensures reliable operation
- **Cross-product knowledge retrieval**: Specialized processing for different documentation domains

### 4. Multilingual Content Processing
- **Language detection challenges**: Automatic identification of content language
- **URL-based language patterns**: Recognition of language indicators in URL paths
- **Language-specific metadata**: Preservation of language information throughout the pipeline
- **Cross-lingual search potential**: Foundation for future cross-language search capabilities

### 5. Integration with External LLMs
- **Format compatibility challenges**: Automated export in formats suitable for ChatGPT/Claude
- **Metadata preservation**: Source and context information maintained in LLM-friendly formats
- **Context window limitations**: Properly structured content to fit within external LLM limitations
- **Multi-platform support**: Works with various cloud-based and local LLM systems

## How It Should Work

WebScrape is designed to function as a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline:

1. **Input Configuration**: Users specify a starting URL, crawl parameters, language preferences, and output settings
2. **Content Discovery**: The system crawls the specified website, respecting depth, domain, and language restrictions
3. **Content Extraction**: Text is extracted from HTML pages using intelligent parsing to handle complex structures
4. **Content Processing**: Raw text is cleaned, normalized, and divided into appropriate chunks with language metadata
5. **Metadata Association**: Each chunk maintains connections to its source URL, language, and context
6. **Embedding Generation**: When Ollama integration is enabled, vector embeddings are created for semantic search
7. **RAG Query Processing**: Streaming response generation for reliable answers with appropriate context
8. **LLM Integration Options**:
   - **Local LLM Usage**: Direct querying via Ollama with streaming responses
   - **External LLM Export**: Generating formatted knowledge documents for upload to ChatGPT/Claude
9. **Output Creation**: All artifacts (raw content, processed chunks, combined knowledge) stored in organized structure

The full version adds a monitoring dashboard and advanced features, while WebScrape Lite focuses on the core functionality, with both supporting the enhanced Ollama integration and external LLM export capabilities.
