# WebScrape Lite Progress Report

## Latest Updates: May 2, 2025

### Ollama RAG Integration + External LLM Support

**Status: Complete with end-to-end pipeline**

We've successfully integrated Ollama with WebScrape Lite for multilingual RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) processing, resolved timeout issues, and created an end-to-end pipeline for transferring RAG content to external LLMs. The implementation now supports:

1. **Streaming Response Generation**:
   - Created `ollama_processor_stream.py` with streaming API to avoid timeouts
   - Implemented partial response handling with proper error management
   - Added timeout detection with graceful failure modes
   - Fixed Python 3.9 compatibility issues (replaced asyncio.timeout with wait_for)

2. **Multilingual Content Support**:
   - Added `--language` parameter for filtering content by language code
   - Created URL pattern matching for language path components (e.g., /en/, /fr/)
   - Documented the feature in `webscrape_lite_language_filter.md`
   - Demonstrated separate datasets for different languages

3. **Enhanced HTML Content Extraction**:
   - Developed `fix_oie_extraction.py` for properly processing HTML content
   - Used BeautifulSoup for intelligent parsing and noise removal
   - Created optimal chunking with appropriate overlap settings
   - Generated 47 well-formed chunks from Okta Identity Engine documentation

4. **Cross-Product Documentation Support**:
   - Created specialized test scripts for different product lines
   - Successfully tested against Okta Workflows and Identity Engine documentation
   - Implemented separate RAG directories for different knowledge domains
   - Added appropriate test queries for each domain

5. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide (`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)
   - Added model fallback mechanisms when desired models aren't available
   - Improved batch processing for embeddings generation
   - Added automatic reconnection with proper error logging

6. **External LLM Integration**:
   - Created `create_combined_knowledge.py` to format RAG content for external LLMs
   - Generates markdown or text files compatible with ChatGPT and Claude
   - Preserves source information and metadata in LLM-friendly format
   - Supports combined export from any RAG directory

7. **End-to-End Pipeline**:
   - Developed `rag_pipeline.py` for complete automated workflow
   - Combines scraping, processing, embedding, and export steps
   - Creates timestamped outputs for organization
   - Provides simplified command interface with sensible defaults

### Next Steps:

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Research streaming compression techniques for faster response times
   - Implement token-aware truncation for optimal context utilization
   - Test with smaller/faster models for real-time applications
   - Explore GPU-based embedding calculation for larger documents

2. **UI Integration**:
   - Create a simple web interface for interacting with RAG data
   - Add visualization of similarity scores and source documents
   - Implement chat-like interface with conversation history
   - Add document preview capabilities

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
   - Add cross-lingual search capabilities
   - Create automated evaluation of RAG quality
   - Explore knowledge graph integration
