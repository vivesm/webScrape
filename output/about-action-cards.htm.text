Action cards
Action cards for applications control various aspects of the application or web service. They cause an action to happen, such as sending a message, adding a record, or updating an existing record. Action cards can retrieve information from the application by searching for records, or looking up customer information, or even downloading a file.
Click the 
Add app Action
 to choose the application with which you want to work, such as 
Salesforce
, 
Slack
, or 
Gmail
. 
After choosing the application, the next step is to select an action card for that application. Each third-party application has a unique set of action cards, based on the application's capabilities and features.
See 
Connectors
 for a complete list of the available third-party connectors and their action cards.
