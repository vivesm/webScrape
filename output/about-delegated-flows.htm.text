Delegated flows
Delegating a workflow is an option to have a flow that an 
Okta
 admin can view and run  directly from the 
Okta
 Admin Console. 
An admin can run a delegated flow  when the following conditions are met:
The flow includes a 
Delegated Flow
 event card.
There's a custom admin role with a resource set that contains the delegated flow.
The admin role contains the 
Run delegated flow
 permission.
The admin role is assigned to one or more admins.
A delegated flow is useful when you want to allow an admin to run a workflow but don't want to grant them full access to 
Okta Workflows
.
