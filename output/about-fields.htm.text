Fields
All input and output fields have a type. There are five basic types:
Text
Number
True/False
Date & Time
File
There are also two special types that are composites of those types:
Object
:  An object is a collection of keys and values where each value can be a different type. For example, a 
Customer
 object could consist of the text strings 
First Name
 and 
Last Name
, an 
ID
 number, and a 
Sign Up
 date and time.
List
: A list is a collection of items that are all the same type, such as a list of numbers or a list of objects.
Field type errors
If you're seeing errors in your flow, one of the first things to check is the types of your fields.
For example, numbers sort differently if set as 
Text
 instead of using the 
Number
 type. For an input field, the card tries to automatically convert any incoming value to the type specified for the input field. 
Type mismatches also occur when a function or action expects a certain type, but instead receives another type that it can't convert. For example, the 
Math - Add
 function accepts text as input and tries to convert to numbers. If you try to add 
10
 and 
potato
, it can convert the number 
10
 to 10 as a string. However, it doesn't know how to convert the string 
potato
 to a number.
For custom output fields, you must set the type correctly or you may encounter errors. For example, don't define your output to accept numbers but then pass it an object.
Custom fields
Many cards allow you to create custom input and output fields. When available, there's is a disabled field that says 
Click or drag to create
 (for a custom output) or 
Click or drop to create
 (for a custom input). After clicking a field, you can give it a unique name.
If you drag an output to an input, the custom field picks up the name and type of the origin or destination. For example, the 
Math-Add
 function comes with two inputs defined, but you can add extra inputs to add more than two numbers.
Dynamic fields
Some cards include dynamic fields. For example:
Google Sheets
 - 
Read Row
:  The output fields correspond to the column headers in the selected spreadsheet.
Salesforce
 - 
Find Record
:  The inputs depend on the record type that you search for.
Common warnings for cards
