Flow aliases
A flow alias is similar to a flow ID. However, a flow identifier  is intentionally decoupled from a flow ID. This means that you can use the alias to invoke the flow even if the flow ID changes.
You can copy the alias for a flow from the 
Endpoint Settings
 dialog, found on the 
API Endpoint
 card. The alias can then be used to invoke the flow.
