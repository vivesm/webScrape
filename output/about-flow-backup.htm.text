Back up flows and folders
If you want to treat your flows like source code, you can perform regular backups, create versions, and restore flows.
Several mechanisms are available to help back up your flows and folders:
Duplicate a folder
Export Flow
 and  
Export Folder
 function cards
Create Pull Request
 action card for the 
GitHub
 connector, so you can make commits and create pull requests in 
GitHub
.
Set up a template for flow backup
 shows how you can import and use the 
Versioning for Flows and Folders
 template directly within your Workflows environment. 
This template demonstrates how to back up flows using a direct commit to 
GitHub
 or a pull request. The template shows how to back up a single flow, but you can modify it to back up multiple flows within a folder.
