Flow charts
In the 
Flow Chart
 subtab, you can view a a high-level visual representation of a flow. Each icon represents an event, an action, or a function.
Because any flow must be triggered by a trigger such as an application event, an API Endpoint, a scheduled event, or a child flow, the first icon in a chart always represents a designated event that monitors for a change in your cloud application. Each subsequent icon represents one specific step in a flow.
