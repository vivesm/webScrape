Flow client token
At the lowest level of security, you can access a flow  using only its alias. 
For medium-security  flows, a  unique client token is used as a query parameter.  This level of security allows a client to pass along a token to identify itself as a safe party to 
Okta Workflows
. You can also pass the token inside the 
x-api-client-token
 header.
Anyone with the client token can access your flow through the following 
Okta Workflows
 API routes:
Invoke a flow
Resume a paused flow
Retry a flow
Generate an open API specification for this flow
