Upgraded and deprecated cards
Action or event cards may need to be upgraded or retired due to API changes, major feature changes, or performance or reliability issues.
Cards can be impacted in the following ways:
Scenario
Impact
A card was upgraded with new functionality.
                            Your current flows will likely be interrupted so long as they are using the card's old functionality.
							To take advantage of the upgrade, you'll have to establish a new connection for that card's connector then remove and replace the existing card.
							For some card upgrades, you may only have to reauthorize your current connection instead of establishing a new one.
In Custom API Action cards, application API endpoints are no longer supported. 
If your Custom API Action card uses any of the unsupported endpoints, then it won't work and your flows won't run.
A card is being deprecated by Okta.
                            You'll no longer be able to add this card to a flow.
                            If you have existing flows with this card, they may remain functional.
