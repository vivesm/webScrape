API developer portal
#
Access the developer portal
The developer portal provides everything you need to discover, test, and consume APIs through a streamlined interface. This guide outlines the full client journey, encompassing everything from accepting an invitation to the portal to managing API keys and testing endpoints.
#
Invitation and first-time login
When an admin invites you to the developer portal, you receive an email containing a secure, time-sensitive link. This link remains valid for 24 hours for first-time logins and 30 minutes for subsequent logins.
You can log in to the developer portal whether you’re accessing it for the first time, returning to the portal, or requesting a new link after your initial one has expired:
For your first login, click the time-sensitive link provided in the invitation email. If the link is still valid, it redirects you to the portal, where you can click
Enter portal
to gain access.
Invitation email
After signing in for the first time, you can return to the portal any time by entering your registered email address on the login page. The system sends a new secure link to your inbox for quick access.
Enter your email to log in to your developer portal
If the link has expired, enter your email address on the portal login page to request a new link. The system sends a new secure link to your inbox, allowing you to regain access.
Request a new login link
After logging in, you can proceed to
Navigate the developer portal
.
#
Navigate the developer portal
The portal dashboard serves as your central hub for managing API collections and interacting with endpoints. It provides the following key functionalities:
Browse API collections
: View your assigned API collections, including details such as methods, parameters, and statuses for each endpoint.
Discover new APIs
: Explore additional available API collections and request access to new APIs directly through the portal.
Test endpoints
: Validate API functionality by sending requests and reviewing responses directly within the portal.
Manage and create API keys
: Generate API keys to authenticate requests, define security parameters, and manage existing keys.
#
Browse API collections
In the
My APIs
tab, you can access your assigned API collections. Selecting a collection opens its documentation, where you can explore endpoint methods, descriptions, and schemas. The documentation includes example requests and responses, where you can also download the OpenAPI specifications.
Browse API collections
#
Discover new APIs
The
Discover new APIs
tab provides access to additional API collections. You can explore these collections to identify APIs that align with your requirements, and
request access
directly through the portal.
#
Request access to new APIs
Complete the following steps to request access to new APIs:
1
Go to the
Discover new APIs
tab to browse available API collections.
Discover new APIs
2
Select the collection you plan to access and click
Request access
.
Request access to an API collection
3
Provide a reason for your request and click
Send request
. An admin reviews your request and determines whether to approve or reject it.
Request access
If the request is approved, the requested APIs appear in your
My APIs
tab, granting you access to their endpoints and documentation.

#
Test endpoints
The portal allows you to test API endpoints directly to validate their functionality. If you do not already have an API key, you must
create one
to generate the required authentication token before testing.
Complete the following steps to test an endpoint:
1
Go to your assigned collection in the
My APIs
tab and choose the endpoint you plan to test.
2
Click
Try it out
to open the testing interface.
Click
Try it out
3
Click
Execute
to send a test request.
Click
Execute
4
Review the response details, including status codes, headers, and payloads, to confirm the endpoint’s behavior.
#
Manage and create API keys
The
Manage API keys
page allows you to manage your credentials. You can create and manage API keys and define security parameters such as allowed and blocked IP addresses.
Complete the following steps to create an API key:
1
Click
Manage API keys
in your profile drop-down.
Manage API keys
2
Click
Create API key
.
Create new API key
3
Provide an
API key name
in the dialog.
Provide an
API key name
4
Optional. Specify
Allowed IPs
to restrict requests to specific IP addresses for enhanced security.
5
Optional. Add
Blocked IPs
to prevent requests from specific IP addresses. Blocked IPs take precedence over allowed IPs. For example, if you add the IP address
123.456.123.456
to your allow list, but also block it, users who attempt to access the portal from this IP address are denied access.
6
Click
Generate
to create the API key. The system displays the authentication token. Save this token securely, as it doesn’t display again. You must refresh or create a new API key if you lose it.
After creating the key, it appears on the
Manage API keys
page. You can use this page to view the token’s details or refresh, deactivate, or delete the key if required.
