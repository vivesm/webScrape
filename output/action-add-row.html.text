Google Sheets
#
Add row action
This action adds a new row to a Google Sheet you select.
LIMITATION WITH GOOGLE SHEETS ACTIONS
Avoid including a colon (
:
) in the names of sheets you plan to use with the
Add row
action. A colon in the sheet name causes an
Unable to parse sheet
error. This is a known limitation within Google Sheets. Specifically, attempting to update multiple cells in a sheet with a colon in its name results in an error, allowing only one cell to update successfully.
