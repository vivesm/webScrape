Configure actions for OData V4 services
To configure the action for an OData V4 API, you need to create a separate connection using the service URL corresponding to V4 and select V4 from the OData version drop-down on the connection page.
1
For creating an action corresponding to OData v4, navigate to the service group in the drop-down. For example, if the service URL configured in the connection is
https://<S4host>/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_bank/srvd_a2x/sap/bank/0003/
, then the service group is
api_bank
.
OData v4 action
SERVICE GROUP NAME
You can confirm the service group name in the API Business Hub documentation. Visit
SAP's documentation
(opens new window)
and locate the
Service Group Name
in the
Attributes
tab.
2
As recommended practice, select the latest API version which can be identified based on the serial number like
<service name>_1
,
<service name>_2
, etc. Here,
API_BANK_3
is the latest and is corresponding to the service URL
https://<S4host>/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_bank/srvd_a2x/sap/bank/0003/
.
3
If it is not shown in the drop-down due to the limited items we populate in the drop-down, then enter the
Service Name
manually. For example, if the service URL is
https://<S4host>/sap/opu/odata4/sap/api_bank/srvd_a2x/sap/bank/0003/
, then service name would be
api_bank/srvd_a2x/sap/bank/0003/
.
Entering service name manually
ODATA V4 API LIMITATIONS
OData v4 API returns 100 records by default for the
Search object
action and the
Extract bulk data
action. You must adjust the
Limit
parameter in the action if you require a higher number of records.
