USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY
This use case serves as an example. Modifications to triggers, actions, or conditional logic may be necessary to adapt this recipe to your workflow.
1
Sign in to Workato.
2
Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
3
Create connections for Active Directory and SFTP:

5
Select an
on-premise group
if your database runs in a network that does not support direct connection. Ensure your on-premise group has an active
on-premise agent
.
6
Provide the profile name defined in your OPA's
config.yml
file in the
On-prem LDAP connection profile
field. This option is only visible when you select an on-premise group that supports
connection profiles
.
7

Using SSH keys for SFTP authentication
SFTP is built on the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), which enables you to use SSH keys in your authentication flow. SSH keys can be used with a user ID and password or independently to authenticate Workato with your SFTP server. This enhances the security of your connection by using SSH encryption for your public and private keys.

For example, this recipe switches the
File path
field to
formula mode
and uses the following file path:
"/sftp/employees_report_{JOB_CREATED_AT}.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}.csv"
In this example,
{JOB_CREATED_AT}
represents the
Job created at
Properties
datapill. This path configuration ensures that each file is uniquely named based on the job creation date.

datapill to the
File contents
field.
Configure the File contents field
5
Use the
Append
drop-down menu to specify whether to append or overwrite the file contents if a file with the same name already exists on the SFTP server.
For example, you can set this field to
Yes
if you plan to re-run a job and add new data to an existing file.
Step summary
This step uses the CSV string and uploads it as a CSV file to a specific path in your SFTP server.
