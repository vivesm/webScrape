Activity audit log
#
Audit log streaming retry
FEATURE AVAILABILITY
Audit log streaming retry is available for all log streaming destinations.
Workato retries sending failed audit logs, such as user activities, job summaries, or job details to the
destination
you specify.
Workato stores audit logs in a persistent cache and applies an exponential backoff formula for retries. The system removes audit logs from the cache when they successfully reach the destination or after seven days without a successful delivery.
Workato marks audit logs as failed events after seven days of unsuccessful retries. Most logs reach the destination within 7-8 retry attempts.
#
Zero retention recipes
FEATURE AVAILABILITY
The zero data retention capability is included in specific pricing plans for direct customers and is available to Embedded partners and their end customers for an additional fee. Refer to your pricing plan and contract to learn more.
You can configure a recipe to have “zero retention" by selecting
Do not store
on the
recipe settings
page. This results in Workato not storing any jobs data, including job lines of input or output, on the Workato platform or in your external storage location.
For zero retention recipes, Workato performs the following tasks:
Sends an audit log without job input and output data.
If the initial attempt to send an audit log for zero retention recipes fails
, Workato completes the following actions:
Stores the audit logs in a persistent cache for retry.
Uses the exponential backoff formula to retry sending the audit log to your destination.
Removes the audit log from the persistent cache upon successful delivery of the audit log to your destination or after seven days, whichever happens earlier.
Logs every retry for an event into the Workato Logs service.
#
Email notifications
When audit log streaming fails, Workato sends email notifications to the workspace admin of your account and to all users designated in the
error notifications
email list.
Audit log streaming can fail due to errors in the connection to your streaming
destination
. We classify these connection error events into two categories: involuntary and voluntary. Our email notification protocols differ for each of these event categories as follows:
#
Voluntary disconnect
A voluntary disconnect is when you disconnect the connection to your destination manually. When this happens, Workato waits eight (8) hours before disabling audit log streaming retry. This delay is designed to account for situations where you temporarily disconnect your connection to update your connection credentials, such as your IAM Role ID. After the eight (8) hour interval has passed, Workato sends an email notification informing you that audit log streaming has stopped. For transparency, when the ALR (Audit Log Receiver) connection has been manually disconnected for more than eight (8) hours and the Workato system disables the ALR, the system logs this action in the activity audit.
The following table describes the frequency and contents of voluntary disconnect notification emails:
Frequency
Contents
One (1) time only.

#
Involuntary disconnect
An involuntary disconnect is when audit logs fail to stream because the connection to your destination is no longer valid. In this scenario, there are two types of error notification emails Workato can send:
General notifications:
Workato sends this type of notification when Audit log streaming stops because of an invalid connection.
All invalid Audit log streaming connections trigger this type of notification email.
Granular notifications:
Workato sends this type of notification when Audit log streaming is disrupted due to an invalid connection caused by specific errors Workato has identified.
Only invalid connections where the error matches one of the error scenarios we’ve already identified trigger these types of email notifications.
The following table describes the frequency and contents of involuntary disconnect notification emails:
Frequency
Contents
No more than one (1) time every 24 hours.

Error codes, as applicable for granular notifications
#
Error codes for granular notifications
This section describes the types of errors Workato can identify. If your connection encounters one of these errors, Workato sends an email notification specifying the error type. If the error you encounter is not listed in this section, Workato sends you a general error notification.
Error codes are organized based on streaming destinations:
S3 error codes
HTTP error codes
Azure Monitor error codes
Azure Blob error codes
#
S3 error codes
Error code
Description
PermanentRedirect
(
301 Moved Permanently
