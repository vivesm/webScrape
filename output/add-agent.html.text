Add Agent to Group
New on-prem group
After you select an on-prem group or create a new group, Workato prompts you to create an agent.
Operating systems
We support the following operating systems:
Windows
Linux
.tar.gz
archive installer
DEB package
RPM package
Docker image
macOS
Click
Add on-prem agent
to start an agent-creation wizard that sets up, runs, and verifies that your agent is active.
#
On-premise agent setup wizard
For this example, we set up an on-prem agent on a Windows OS.
Windows Service user account
Starting from version
2.18.0
Workato on-prem agent windows service user account is set to
Local Service
instead of
Local System
used in previous versions.
You can change the user account by editing the OPA windows service properties.
#
Step 1: Install On-prem agent
1
Open your On-prem group page and click
Add new agent
. Provide a meaningful agent name, and select your operating system (OS) for the agent installation.
Choose OS
2
Read and accept the
End User License Agreement
.

Download the installer file to the on-prem system and start installation. The wizard provides OS-specific installation instructions.
Install agent
#
Step 2: Activate and start On-prem agent
1
During agent installation, you will be asked for an activation code. You can find it in Step 4 of the wizard in Workato. Just copy the code and paste it into the Windows installer.
Please note that the traffic to Workato should be allowed from your server - see more information

.
Alternatively, you can activate your agent later on by running

folder in your agent installation directory.

After the agent becomes active, click
Test agent
to verify that the connection is successful.

OPA Windows service account
After installing OPA as the Windows service you can change its settings like user account. Navigate to the service configuration (

) to change it. By default, OPA Windows service user account is set to
Local Service
.
