Agentic
Agentic is a low-code, no-code platform that enables you to rapidly build and manage powerful AI agents that take action and orchestrate workflows dynamically.
This platform approach enables you to customize and manage purpose-specific AI agents that understand your intent and context to perform the following actions:
Retrieve relevant information
from various knowledge bases.
Take action
on apps and data securely with governance.
Orchestrate workflows
end-to-end dynamically.
Collaborate
with other AI agents and humans to execute complex workflows.
#
Agentic capabilities
The term agentic derives from the concept of agency, which refers to the ability to act independently and make informed choices. Genies are agents that you can build in Agent Studio. Your genies use the knowledge base and skill sets you configure to manage tasks and workflows.
#
Agentic learning ability
Your genie uses a large language model (LLM) and a detailed prompt to learn new information. The knowledge base recipes and skills recipes that you configure continuously learn from new inputs and adapt to handle dynamic situations effectively.
For example, an IT support genie assists employees who reports losing their connection to a critical app. Within minutes, multiple users report the same issue, suggesting a potential system outage or server disruption. The IT genie adapts by relying on the following learning framework:
Identify patterns
: Your genie uses an LLM to recognize the spike in lost connection reports as a system-wide issue rather than an isolated incident.
Proactive escalation
: Your genie automatically notifies the IT team about the pattern, including key details such as the app affected, the number of users impacted, and the timeframe of the reports.
Provide updates
: Your genie shares progress updates with users as the IT team investigates, such as estimated resolution times or alternative workarounds, based on real-time information.
Logging insights
: Your genie stores data from the incident, including affected regions and user feedback, for post-resolution analysis and future improvements.

Identity provider user access
You can add users to the Agentic platform through your external identity provider (IdP). This enables you to authenticate user accounts for Agentic access. You must configure a SAML-based SSO through your IdP before you can provide a user with access to Agentic. Agentic adds users when they sign in through your IdP for the first time. Multiple IdPs are supported. The steps in this section use Okta as an example.
Complete the following steps to configure your IdP:
1

Okta
