API developer portal
The API developer portal allows administrators to securely share API documentation, manage client access, and promote API adoption. Clients can use the portal to explore assigned APIs, view documentation, generate credentials, and test endpoints.
The developer portal supports two key user flows:
Administrators
: Configure the portal’s branding, invite clients, and manage API access. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the
Configure the developer portal
guide.
Clients
: Access a personalized portal to explore assigned APIs, review documentation, and test endpoints. Learn more in the
Access the developer portal
section.
#
Configure the developer portal
Administrators are responsible for setting up and managing the developer portal, which ensures a seamless and branded experience for clients. Administrators can customize the portal’s appearance, assign API collections, and manage client access. Use the following guides to configure and manage your portal effectively:
Configure your developer portal
Add clients to the portal
Manage client access
Review collection access requests
Publish API collections
#

drop-down menu to select which API collections to publish in the portal. These collections appear in the Discover new APIs section of your API developer portal, where clients can search for and request access to them.
Select which API collections to publish
10
Click
Next
to make your portal live.
After you publish a portal, it remains live. There is no option to take the portal offline. You can still update configurations such as branding, collections, or client access at any time. To review changes, use the portal preview to see how it appears to your clients.
PORTAL ACCESS REQUIREMENT
You must configure an API client with portal access to preview the developer portal. Only registered API clients can access it. Refer to the
Create a new API client
guide for more information.
Developer portal settings
To manage client access, go to the
Clients
tab to
add clients to your portal
.
#
Add and configure clients in the portal
You can add new clients to the portal and configure their access through email invitations. Each invitation includes a unique, time-sensitive link for secure access. During setup, you define the API collections the client can access and configure their authentication method. Clients use the portal to generate tokens and interact with the assigned APIs.
Complete the following steps to add and configure clients in the portal:
1
Go to
API Platform > Clients > All clients
.
2
Click
+ Add new client
.
Add new client
3
Enter a
Name
for your client. Use a descriptive identifier, such as the client’s company or department name.
Set up client details
4
Enter a
Description
for the client.
5
Upload a
Client logo
. Drag and drop a JPG/PNG image or click
Upload from device
to select a file. This logo visually identifies your client in the portal.
6
Enable the
Grant client access to portal
toggle to enable portal access. This grants your client permission to browse published API collections and manage their API keys. If your client doesn't require access to the developer portal, you can leave the toggle disabled.
7
Enter the
Email
address of the client. The system sends an invitation to this email, allowing your client to log in and access the portal.
8
Click
Next
to proceed to the
Define access configuration
screen, where you can configure your client’s API access.
9
Use the
API collections to include
drop-down menu to select one or more API collections. This defines the APIs your client can access and invoke. Each client must have access to at least one collection.
Define access configuration
10
Choose an
Authentication method
for the client. For more information, refer to the
available authentication methods
.
11
Optional. Assign a
Policy
to control your client’s API usage. Policies define rules such as rate limits or usage quotas.
12
Click
Next
to complete the process. If portal access is enabled, the system sends an email invitation to the client's email address you specify. Permissions, such as API collections and authentication methods, are configured directly at the client level.
Create client
After receiving the email invitation, clients can use the time-sensitive link to access the portal. After logging in, they create
API keys
to generate authentication tokens for secure interaction with their assigned collections and endpoints. Each client can create up to a maximum of 10 API keys.
#
Manage client access
The
Clients
tab provides access to the
All clients
page, where you can review client details, update access configurations, or revoke access as required. The page displays key information such as the client name, email, accessible collections, and assigned policies.
All clients page
To manage a specific client’s access, click on their name to open their details page. From here, you can configure the following settings:
Edit client details
Access configuration
API keys
Review collection access requests
#
Edit client details
Click
Edit client
to update basic client information, such as the client’s name or email address, from the client details page.
Edit client details
#
Access configuration
The
Access configuration
tab allows you to manage your client’s access to API collections and set usage policies.
From this tab, you can view and adjust the
Accessible collections
assigned to the client. Add or remove collections to tailor access based on the client's specific requirements.
Edit accessible API collections
CLIENT ACCESS LIMITATION
Every client must have access to at least one API collection. When modifying a client's access to API collections, you can't remove a client’s last remaining accessible collection.
If you try to remove the last collection and click
Save
, the action fails, and Workato displays an error message explaining the limitation. Ensure the client retains access to at least one collection before saving your changes.
To enforce usage restrictions, add or edit a
Policy
that defines rules such as rate limits or usage quotas.
#
API keys
The
API keys
tab enables you to create and manage authentication tokens. You can generate new keys with optional IP restrictions for enhanced security or manage existing keys by refreshing or deactivating them as needed.
Manage API keys
API keys provide secure authentication, allowing your clients to access their assigned API collections while maintaining strict access controls.
#
Review collection access requests
When a portal client requests access to an API collection, the request appears in the
Pending collection access requests
section within the
Clients
tab.
In this section, you can review the requested API collections and the client’s justification for needing access.
Review requested API collections
Choose to
Approve
or
Reject
requests directly from this page. Approving grants the client access to the requested collections, while rejecting keeps the client’s current permissions unchanged.
#
Publish API collections
Only active collections appear in the portal catalog. A collection is active if it contains at least one active endpoint. Inactive collections with zero active endpoints don't appear in the
Discover my APIs
section, even if published.
Complete the following steps to publish an API collection in the developer portal:
1
Go to
Platform > API platform > API collections
page and select the collection you plan to publish.
2
Locate the
Visibility on portal
section on the collection’s
Endpoints
page. Collections default to
Private
if they are not initially published to the portal.
3
Click
Publish to portal
to make the collection discoverable to your clients.
Publish your API collection
You can also publish collections from the
API collections
tab. Click
•••
(ellipsis) next to the collection and select
Publish collection
.
Publish your API collection from the API collections tab
#
Access the developer portal
The developer portal provides secure access to explore APIs, manage collections, and test endpoints. After receiving your invitation email, you can use the time-sensitive link to log in and access your dashboard. From the dashboard, you can browse assigned APIs, request access to additional collections, and manage API keys.
For more information, refer to the
Access the developer portal
guide.
