API gateway
An API gateway acts as a single entry point for multiple APIs, allowing you to manage, secure, and optimize your APIs effectively. It ensures that all API requests are routed correctly and that responses are returned efficiently. An API gateway is crucial for managing and exposing APIs in a secure and scalable manner.
#
