API monitoring & analytics
Track and analyze API usage and performance with comprehensive monitoring and analytics tools. The
API platform dashboard
enables you to visualize real-time data for your endpoints and API collections. You can view metrics such as response times, error messages, and traffic patterns, enabling proactive management and optimization of APIs.
You can also maintain detailed records of all API requests with the
API logs
feature. This tool provides transparency and control over API usage, allowing you to monitor access patterns, diagnose issues, and ensure optimal performance. Use comprehensive filtering options to find specific logs by time period, status, client, or collection type. Export logs as CSV files for further analysis and reporting.
By leveraging the dashboard and logs together, you gain a holistic view of your API platform’s health, facilitating better decision-making and enhanced performance.
