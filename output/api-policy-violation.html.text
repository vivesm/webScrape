RecipeOps - API policy quota violation trigger
This trigger monitors API usage for the workspace. A trigger event occurs each time an access profile exceeds a policy quota threshold. For policies with longer quota intervals, duplicate events occur if the same threshold is exceeded every 30 days.

API access policies

#
Trigger behavior
For each workspace, this trigger captures instances when a unique access profile exceeds the following policy request thresholds:
80% of quota
90% of quota
100% of quota
RECIPEOPS BEHAVIOR
The 30-day reference only affects policies with a quota interval longer than 30 days. For example, with a policy of 1,000 requests and a 90-day interval, the system triggers an event if you reach 800 requests (80% threshold) in the first month. If there are no new requests in the following month and the usage still stands at 800 requests (80%), a second event triggers. For longer quota intervals, every 30 days, a trigger event is created when hitting the same threshold.
