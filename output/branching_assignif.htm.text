Assign If
Assign a value based on the true or false result of a conditional statement. If you have more than two potential output values, see 
Lookup
.
Input
Field
Definition
Type
Required
value a
Value to be compared.
Various
FALSE
comparison
What comparison to make (see table below).
Various
FALSE
value b
Value to compare against.
Various
FALSE
value if true
Value to assign to the output field if the comparison is true.
Various
FALSE
value if false
Value to assign to the output field if the comparison is false.
Various
FALSE
Be sure to set the type of 
value a
 and 
value b
 to reflect how you would like the comparison to be done. For example, the operator 
greater than
 compares numbers based on numeric value but text based on alphabetical sort order. So the number comparison 
80 > 9
 is true, but the text comparison 
"80" > "9"
 is false.

Operator
Use Case
equal to 
Compare two texts, numbers, dates or true/false to see if they have the same value.
not equal to
   Compare two texts, numbers, dates or true/false to see if they have different values.
greater than or equal
     Compare two texts, numbers or dates to see if the first has the same or greater value than the second.  
less than or equal   
Compare two texts, numbers or dates to see if the first has the same or lesser value than the second.  
greater than 
Compare two texts, numbers or dates to see if the first has a greater value than the second.  
less than   
Compare two texts, numbers or dates to see if the first has a lesser value than the second.  
a multiple of  
Compare two numbers to see if value a is an exact multiple of value b. For example, 12, 0 and -4 are all multiples of 4, but 2, 3 and 7 are not. 
in   
Compare two texts to see if value a is a part of value b. For example, "test" is in "this is a test", but there is no "i" in "team".
not in 
Compare two texts to see if value a is not part of value b.  
has key 
When value a is an object and value b is text, tests to see if the object has a key with the specified name. For example, true if value a is {"test":123} and value b is "test".
doesn't have key   
When value a is an object and value b is text, tests to see if the object does not have a key with the specified name.  
is empty   
Checks to see if value a is empty; ignores value b. What defines "empty" varies by type. Note: Only works for Text and Object. Numbers, Dates, and Boolean are viewed as empty.
