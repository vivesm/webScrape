Lookup Table
Click the bottom row to add new rows. Click the

 at the left of a row to delete a row.
When Value Is:
 Possible input values.
Then Result Is:
 Corresponding results for each value. Same type as 
Result

FALSE
Otherwise Result Is
The result to use if there are no matches in the lookup table. Same type as 
Result
 output.
Various
FALSE
Output
Result
: The result of the lookup. If an exact match is found for 
Value
 in the 
When Value Is
 column, then 
Result
 is set to the corresponding value in the 
Then Result Is
 column; otherwise, 
Result
 is set to the 
Other Result Is
 value. Defaults to type text. If you change the type, then it also automatically changes the type for the 
Then Result Is
 column and the 
Otherwise Result Is
 input.

Construct
 and 
Get
 for lookup tables where the potential values for the result are not known in advance (that is, are set by outputs when the flow runs). Build the object at runtime using 
Construct
 and then use 
Get
 to do the lookup. Alternatively, you can also do this using nested 
If/Else
 or successively linked 
Assign If
 functions.
