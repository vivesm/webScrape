Build a delegated flow
You can delegate a workflow to an 
Okta
 admin who can view and run it directly from the 
Admin Console
. This gives admins the ability to run automations without granting them direct access to 
Okta Workflows
.
To build a delegated flow, use the 
Delegated Flow
 event card from the 
Add event
 dialog.
