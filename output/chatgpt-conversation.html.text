System role message
Optional message to provide specific instructions to the model before starting a conversation.
Name
Name of the author of a specific message. Often utilized for tracking chat transcripts easily. This can contain uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and underscores with a maximum length of 64 characters (no blank spaces).
Model
Select the OpenAI model to which you plan to send the message.
Temperature
Enter a value between 0 and 2 for controlling the randomness of completions. Higher values will make the output more random, while lower values will make it more focused and deterministic. We recommend to use this or top p but not both. Learn more

.
Number of chat completions
The number of completions to generate as the message response.
Stop phrase
A specific stop phrase that will end generation. For example, if you set the stop phrase to a period (.) the model will generate text until it reaches a period, and then it will stop. Use this to control the amount of text generated.
Maximum tokens
The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus the value here cannot exceed the model's context length. For longer prompts, we recommend setting a low value and if the prompt is likely to vary in length, we recommend leaving it blank.
Presence penalty
A number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
User
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.
