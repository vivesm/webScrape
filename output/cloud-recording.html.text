Download URLs for Zoom recording files
Each cloud-recorded meeting or webinar on Zoom includes various file types, each with its own download URL. The availability of these files depends on the features used during the meeting. For instance, no chat file is available if the chat feature was not used during the meeting.
The download URLs for these files can be found in the output of the following triggers and actions:
Cloud recording transcript completed
in the
New event
trigger
Cloud recording completed
in the
New event
trigger
Get cloud recording
in the
Get object by ID
action
Each of these triggers and actions generates a list of
Recording files
for the cloud recording.

Retrieve recording files using a download token
If you use
Cloud recording completed
in the
New event
trigger, the output provides a download token. This token allows you to download the cloud recording even if it is password protected, which is a recommended security default. The token expires 24 hours after the recording is completed.
The following recipe uses
Cloud recording completed
in the
New event
trigger to generate a download token, enabling you to download Zoom cloud recordings and upload them to Dropbox.
Download cloud recording in Zoom
In this example, Workato processes new cloud recordings completed in Zoom. For each file in the
Recording files
list, the recipe downloads the cloud recording file using the
Download URL
and
Download token
from
Cloud recording completed
in the
New event
trigger. It then maps each file to its respective fields.
Then, the recipe sets a file extension based on the
Recording file
type.
Set file extension
This enables you to name each
Recording file
with the appropriate file extension and prevent issues with accessing the files.
Upload the file to Dropbox
