SQL Collection by Workato FAQs
Get answers to frequently asked SQL Collection by Workato questions.
What is SQL Collection by Workato and why should I use it?
SQL Collection by Workato
is a native application that allows you to manipulate table data. You should use this app to synchronize related data across multiple systems, such as databases and web services. SQL Collection by Workato lets you run SQL statements with data from various sources and create temporary tables for data processing.
How does SQL Collection handle data transformation?
SQL Collection handles
data transformation
seamlessly as it is built on SQL lite and functions like a database. You can create lists and query them using standard SQL syntax, including keywords like
WHERE
,
GROUP BY
, and
JOIN
. After you transform data, you can load it directly into your target system or export it as a CSV file.
Does SQL Collection work with large datasets?
Yes. SQL Collection supports
large datasets
, but performance depends on the structure of your data, including row size and column count. We recommend that you use datasets that don't exceed
50,000 records
per SQL Collection list to ensure reliable performance.
SQL Collection can handle larger datasets, such as 100,000 to 200,000 records, if the rows are small and have fewer columns. Datasets that exceed the recommended limits may impact performance or stability. Split tables into smaller chunks or use parallel recipes to process larger datasets efficiently.
Is a connection setup required to use SQL Collection by Workato?
No. SQL Collection does not require a
connection setup
. You can start using SQL Collection by selecting
App > SQL Collection by Workato
from the recipe editor.
What are the available actions in SQL Collection by Workato?
SQL Collection offers several
actions
, including:
Create list in SQL Collection action
Insert rows in SQL Collection action
Create list in SQL Collection from CSV
Insert rows in SQL Collection from CSV file
Query list in SQL Collection
How does the Create list in SQL Collection action work?
This action
creates a SQL Collection list
in the recipe from a list input. The SQL Collection list contains column headers based on the list's schema. You can specify primary and secondary indexes for the list.
What should I do if I encounter a COLLECTION DATE ERROR when using SQL Collection for dates?
You may receive an
invalid format error
for the Date field. To correct this error, you must use Mapper by Workato to update the date format or skip date fields if they are not required.
How does the Query list in SQL Collection action work?
This action allows you to
perform standard SQL queries
on your lists. You can write your SQL query, define the schema, and choose whether to convert the results to a CSV string.
What should I keep in mind when using SQL keywords in the Query list in SQL Collection action?
Some
SQL keywords
, like
DELETE
, do not return list outputs. This means that datapills from these actions should not be used to export your list.
