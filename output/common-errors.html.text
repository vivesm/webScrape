Webhooks - Debug common errors
This guide explains common errors encountered when using the Webhooks connector and how to resolve these errors.
#
Error generating schema for response
This error occurs when there is a mismatch between the detected
Content-Type
in the webhook header and the actual payload data type.
For example, if the webhook header indicates a JSON payload, but the actual payload is XML (such as
<id>1</id>
), an error occurs when Workato attempts to parse the data.
#
Cause
This issue often arises with legacy or custom applications that do not adhere to standard HTTP practices, particularly when the
Content-Type
header does not match the payload format.
#
Resolution
Check with the application owner to confirm that the webhook API is sending data in the correct format.
If modifying the webhook format is not possible, click
Skip guided setup
and manually configure the payload schema.
#
Webhook events receiving a 400 Bad Request error
A
400 Bad Request
error occurs when there is a mismatch between the expected and actual payload type or when the payload has incompatible character encoding.
#
Cause
Workato validates JSON-based webhooks, as defined by the
Webhook type
setting. If the payload is not valid JSON, Workato returns a
400 Bad Request
error.
Workato also ensures that JSON, Form, and XML-based webhooks are UTF-8 compatible. If the payload is not UTF-8 compatible, Workato returns a
400 Bad Request
error.
#
Resolution
Verify that the incoming webhook payload matches the defined
Webhook type
.
If the payload contains non-UTF-8 characters, use the
Raw Binary Data
option under
Webhook Type
.
#
Webhook trigger errors
Webhook trigger errors occur when Workato fails to accept or process a webhook event. These errors fall into two categories:
Webhook gateway errors
: These occur at the gateway level due to rate limiting, verification failures, or invalid requests. These errors prevent the webhook event from being processed.
Webhook processing errors
: These occur after the event is accepted by the gateway and may result from data parsing issues, processing logic failures, or downstream service errors.
ERROR LOGGING
All webhook errors are automatically logged by the
Workato Logging Service
. The following example displays log data for a webhook error:
Webhook errors
#
Cause
Webhook trigger errors can occur due to:
Invalid request formats
Incorrect webhook URLs
Server issues
Data format mismatches between Workato and external systems
For example, if Workato receives webhook events from Quickbase, which represents date fields differently than Workato, a schema mismatch can occur. If the Workato webhook schema expects a
Date
format but receives a
String
, the event may be received but not processed, leading to silent failures.
TRIGGER ERRORS VISIBILITY
When a trigger error occurs, no job is generated. As a result, there is no job ID or entry in the job history table. These errors are only visible on the
logging service page
(opens new window)
. Data-related errors don't generate prompts or notifications because no job was created.

#
Resolution
Ensure that the data types in your Workato webhook schema match the expected format from the external application.
Use the
Workato Logging Service
to analyze error logs and determine the cause of webhook trigger errors.
Filter webhook trigger errors on the
logging service page
(opens new window)
to identify and troubleshoot specific issues.
