Add conditions to formulas
It is also important to create recipes that are resilient against unexpected scenarios. For example, your trigger data might contain missing values or contain a data of another datatype.
You can use conditional logic to prepare your recipes for these situations.
#
Conditionals
You can conditionally execute formulas using Ruby's ternary syntax (popular shortcut for if-else statements). Ternary syntax are of the form:
condition ? expression1 : expression2
#
Behavior
#
condition
A boolean expression that evaluates to
true
or
false
.
#
expression1
Returns this expression if
condition
is
true
.
#
expression2
Returns this expression if
condition
is
false
.
#
Example: Using first name or full name
In the following example, we conditionally pass in either the
Full name
or
First name
into the
Message
input field.
Checks if
Full name
is present. Outputs
Full name
if present, or
First name
if not present.
Here is a detailed explanation of what the ternary formula does:
Full name
.present?
will check if the
Full name
pill has a value . If it has a value, it evaluates to
true
. If it has no value, it evaluates to
false
.
The second
?
in the formula separates the condition to evaluate from the expressions to return. Note, the first
?
is part of the
.present?
formula
whilst the second
?
is separated with a space character and is part of the ternary syntax.
If there is a value in the
Full name
pill when the job is ran, the value for
Full name
will mapped to the
Message
input.
If there is no value in the
Full name
pill when the job is ran, the value for
First name
will be mapped to the
Message
input. Of course, if there's also no value in this
First name
pill, the job will fail at this step if
Message
is a required input field.

Example: Skip field if empty
When updating records, you want to preserve existing data while changing only the updated fields. In this situation, can you use the
skip
formula to instruct the Workato action to leave this field untouched.
This example attempts use an updated Salesforce record to update a lead in Marketo. It checks if the Salesforce
Company
is present. If yes, it will output the Salesforce
Company
into Marketo. Otherwise, the Marketo record is left untouched.
Checks if
Company
is present. Outputs
Company
if present, otherwise, leaves this field untouched
How to avoid passing any values
The
skip formula
will avoid passing any data to the input field.
#
Safe Navigation Operator
Checks if the input is valid. If true, it performs a specified operation on the input data. Otherwise, it will return a
null
value.
#
Syntax
Input
&.
operation
Input
- An input datapill. It can by any datatype.
operation
- If the input is not
null
, this formula will be applied to the input data. This formula must be compatible with the input datatype.
#
How it works
The Safe Navigation Operator (
&.
) checks if the input data is valid. It returns a
null
value if the input data is
null
or undefined. If the input is valid, it will perform the operation specified by the
operation
argument. It enables you to write simpler expressions to handle
null
values.
Before
The
Created Date
datapill needs to be converted to a date datatype using the
to_date
formula. Since the formula will encounter an error if the datapill contains
null
value, you would have to use a ternary expression to work around this logic.
Using ternary conditions
After
Use the
&.
operator instead. The safe navigation operator allows you to manage cases where
Created Date
contains a
null
value, while writing a simpler formula expression.
