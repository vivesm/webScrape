Configure a connection
When you add a card to a flow, you need to select or create a connection to authenticate with that application or service. 
After your remote account connection is configured, 
Okta
 saves your account information, so you can reuse the connection when you build any other flow that uses the same connector.
You can create and save multiple connection configurations and share them with other Workflow admins in your org.
New connections
You can create connections for your flows using the 
Connections
 page of the Workflows console.
To set up a new connection configuration, complete these steps:
On the 
Connections
 page of the Workflows console, click 
New Connection
.
From the 
New Connection
 selector pop-up, click the icon that corresponds to the application or service you want to connect.
The next steps depend on how the connection is made to the external application or service.
OAuth 2.0 connections
This procedure covers setting up connections that use the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol:
On the 
General
 tab, fill out the fields as follows:
In the 
Name
 field, enter a unique name for this specific connection. This is useful  if you have  multiple accounts connecting to the same application or service.
Add a helpful 
Description
 to detail any other  information relevant to this connection. The description text appears on the 
Connections
 page of the Workflows console, along with the connection 
Name
.
For an external application or service that uses OAuth 2.0 for connections,  you can click the 
Permissions
 tab to review which particular scopes are requested for this connection.
Configurable scopes
In some newer external applications or services that use OAuth 2.0, you can choose or modify the requested scopes.
This is useful if you need to create multiple connections that call the same service, but need to specify different scopes.
For example, one connection to an email service might include the 
read-email
 scope for simple administration. A more advanced  connection to the same service could also include the 
delete-email
 and 
send-email
 scopes.
On the 
Permissions
 tab:
Select 
Use default scopes
 to  create the connection using the pre-defined scopes. 
Select 
Customize scopes (advanced)
 to select individual scopes. You can't clear any required scopes.
If you remove a scope that isn't marked as required, but is used by the connector, then  your event and action cards may not function properly.
You can use the search field to type in part of the scope name and filter the list of individual scopes.
If supported by the connector, you can also manually add other scopes. Enter the scope names, either individually or as a list of space or comma-separated values, in the 
Manually add scopes
 field and click 
Add
.
If the connector doesn't support adding other scopes, you can submit a request to add scopes to the connector through the 
Okta
 Ideas
 site.
Click 
Create
 to complete the configuration. If required, 
Okta
 prompts you to enter your sign-in credentials for the destination site.
Other authentication protocols
This procedure covers setting up connections that don't use the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol:
In the 
Name
 field, enter a unique name for this specific connection. This is useful  if you have  multiple accounts connecting to the same application or service.
Add a helpful 
Description
 to detail any other  information relevant to this connection. The description text appears on the 
Connections
 page of the Workflows console, along with the connection 
Name
.
If your connection requires any necessary credentials, enter these values in the additional fields. This may be a specific service domain, an API token, or a paired access key and secret. The security requirements depend on the external application or service.
Click 
Create
 to complete the configuration. If required, 
Okta
 prompts you to enter your sign-in credentials for the destination site.
Existing connections
You can modify existing connections  using the 
Connections
 page of the Workflows console.
Click the 
Name
 field to change this connector name.
Click the 
Description
 field to change this connector description.
Test Connection
: Validate that the connection is working.
Usage
: See which flows are using a particular connection.
Reauthorize
: If you update the password, API key, or another setting for an application, you need to reauthorize your application. Click the 
Reauthorize
 icon and follow the steps to update your connection. Be sure to reauthorize each connection to the same application. 
Delete
: Remove the connection. Any flows that use this connection must be updated to use a different connection.
For more details about managing existing connections, see 
Connections page
