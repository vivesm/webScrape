API proxy endpoints
#
Configure a new API proxy endpoint
Complete the following steps to configure a new API proxy endpoint:
Prerequisites
Step 1: Create the endpoint
Step 2: View the proxy endpoint
Step 3: Configure the schema
#
Prerequisites
Before creating a new API proxy endpoint, ensure that you complete the following prerequisites:
Create an HTTP connection
to enable Workato to forward requests to the external API.
Create an API proxy collection
to organize related endpoints.
Review the
endpoint path guidelines
to ensure consistent and valid path configurations.
#
Create the endpoint
Complete the following steps to create a proxy endpoint:
1
Go to
Platform > API platform > API collections
in the Orchestrate platform and select the API proxy collection for which you plan to create the new endpoint.
2
Select
+ New endpoint
.
Select
+ New endpoint
3
Fill in the following fields:
HTTP method
Use the
HTTP method
drop-down menu to specify the method for the endpoint.
Endpoint name
Enter a descriptive name for the proxy endpoint.
Endpoint path
Define a path to append to both proxy and target base URLs, which can include
path parameters
. Ensure that the path follows the
endpoint path guidelines
.
Request timeout
Enter the
Request timeout
duration to set the time allowed for a request to complete. The value must be between 1 and 30 seconds, with 30 seconds as the maximum and default value.
4
Select
Add endpoint
. The new proxy endpoint appears on the API collection page.
5
Click
•••
(ellipsis) next to the endpoint to rename, activate, or delete it.
#
View the proxy endpoint
Select an API endpoint in the API collection overview to view its details. You can also download these details in the
OpenAPI 2.0 specification
from the API collection overview.
A
proxy-based endpoint
includes the following tabs:
The
Details
tab summarizes settings from the following components in the proxy workflow:
View a proxy-based endpoint's
Details
tab
New API proxy request trigger
Defines the schema for incoming requests, including the content type, query parameters, body, headers, and the expected response schema.
Forward request to target action
By default, all proxy endpoints forward requests to the target API. If needed, you can
transform incoming request data
, such as headers, query parameters, and the request body, before forwarding it to the target API endpoint. Refer to the
API proxy transformation
guide to learn how to transform requests.
Return response action
Configures the response sent to the client, including the content type, headers, HTTP status codes, and body. You can also
transform the response
by modifying its data before sending it to the client.
If you created an endpoint manually or chose
Manual configuration
when creating the collection, you must configure the schema and headers. For more information, refer to
Configure the schema
.
If you imported an OpenAPI specification when you created the collection, the schema and headers for each endpoint are preconfigured.
The
Target URL
section displays the address that requests to the proxy endpoint are forwarded to. You can modify the target URL by modifying the associated HTTP connection in the API proxy collection settings.
The
Test request
tab enables you to
test the proxy endpoint
by sending sample requests and reviewing responses.
View a proxy-based endpoint's
Test
tab
This tab includes the following sections:
Parameters
Lists the required query parameters, headers, and request body for the endpoint.
Responses
Displays the expected HTTP status codes and response schema for the client.
The
Settings
tab allows you to update proxy endpoint details. For example, you can adjust the request timeout for specific API requirements or rename an endpoint for better organization.

Settings
tab
You can make changes directly in this tab and click
Save
to apply them.
#
Configure the schema
IMPORT OPENAPI SPEC FOR AUTOMATIC SETUP
To automatically configure the endpoint schema, select
Import OpenAPI specification
when
creating a new API proxy collection
. Workato will populate the schema for each endpoint in the collection.
If you created an endpoint manually or selected
Manual configuration
when setting up the API proxy collection, configure the schema and headers in the
New API proxy request
trigger.
Complete the following steps to configure the schema:
1
Open the
New API proxy request
trigger from your proxy workflow.
2
Expand the
Request
section and configure the following fields:
Request body
Define the schema for the body of incoming requests. This applies to HTTP methods like POST, PUT, or PATCH. You can either paste a sample JSON payload or add fields manually.
Request query parameters
Describe one or more request query parameters.
Request headers
Add any required headers to the request.
3
Expand the
Response schema
section and configure the following fields:
Response content type
Required.
Specify the format of the response, such as JSON or XML.
Response headers
Specify any headers that you plan to include in the HTTP response.
Responses
Required.
Specify at least one
HTTP status code
, such as
200 - OK
, and describe the expected response body schema. Click
Use JSON
to paste or upload example JSON output, or manually define fields in the response body.
4
Click
Save
to apply your changes.
Your schema configuration is complete. To learn how to test your new proxy endpoint, see
Test a proxy endpoint
.
