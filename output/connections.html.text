RETRIEVE QUICKBOOKS REALM ID
Retrieve your company's Quickbooks Realm ID using the
List connections
API. Disconnect and reconnect your Quickbooks connection in Workato before calling the API to ensure the latest information is retrieved. The API returns the Realm ID in the
identity
field of the response, following your email address. In the preceding example, ACME's Realm ID is
1029384756102938
. For other connections, the identity field is returned as
null
.
Refer to the
SDK identity lambda documentation
for more details on setting up the
identity
field. The lambda’s output value is returned in the
identity
field of the list connections API.
