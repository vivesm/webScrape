Connector Builder
Okta Workflows
Connector Builder
 is a no-code development tool for creating connectors on the Workflows platform. It uses the same functionality used by 
Okta
 customers to turn their use cases into automated flows.
Fundamentally, a connector is a collection of API endpoints and data manipulation functions sequenced as flows. 
Connector Builder
 packages these flows with authentication and branding. Customers can use these connectors in their own tenants, or submit them to the 
Okta Integration Network
 for inclusion in the public catalog for use by anyone using the 
Okta Workflows
 platform.
