Formula Copilot
FEATURE AVAILABILITY
Copilot is available for all direct customers across all Workato data centers. It is available to Embedded partners in the admin workspace, but is not available in Embedded customer workspaces. All data is sent to OpenAI's servers in the US. You can opt-in to this feature by agreeing to our

Workato’s Formula Copilot leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance your experience in formula mode. This AI-powered feature provides assistance based on your formula requirements. You can create complex data transformations or fine-tune your formatting by directly prompting Copilot, which offers tailored suggestions and examples.
