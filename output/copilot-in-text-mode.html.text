Mapper Copilot
FEATURE AVAILABILITY
Copilot is available for all direct customers across all Workato data centers. It is available to Embedded partners in the admin workspace, but is not available in Embedded customer workspaces. All data is sent to OpenAI's servers in the US. You can opt-in to this feature by agreeing to our

Workato's Mapper Copilot enhances text manipulation in your recipes by providing AI-powered assistance directly within the recipe editor. You can use this feature to compose text that incorporates datapills, such as drafting emails, Slack notifications, or descriptions for invoices.

Additionally, Mapper Copilot allows you to quickly search and select from thousands of datapills in a recipe for accurate data handling.
