DEPRECATION OF FULFILLMENT API IN THE 2022-04 RELEASE
Shopify has deprecated the Fulfillment API in its 2022-04 REST Admin API release in favor of Fulfillment Orders. While we've implemented changes to ensure usability of the old action, we encourage you to update your recipes to the new "Create Fulfillment" action which uses the new Fulfillment Order API. We will also be deprecating the old action moving forward.
