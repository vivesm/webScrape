Custom domain and email server
The custom domain and email server features work together to provide a personalized and branded experience for Workflow app users. This ensures a seamless experience between your application and Workflow apps.
CNAME AND SPF RECORD SETUP
Configuring a custom domain and email server involves adding a CNAME and an SPF record to your DNS settings. A CNAME aliases one domain to another and is required for a custom domain setup, while an SPF record specifies authorized mail servers. Although both can be used in the same registered domain, they can't coexist on the same domain or subdomain. For example, you can use a CNAME for a subdomain like
www.example.com
and an SPF record for the root domain,
example.com
.
#
Custom domain
A custom domain enables you to use your own domain name instead of the default Workato domain (
{customer_subdomain}.workato.app
) for your Workflow apps. This means that you can set up your DNS (Domain Name System) domain to access the
Apps portal
, pages, tasks, links, and email communications using a custom domain.
Custom domains follow the
{custom_subdomain}.{customer_domain}/portal
format. For example:
https://apps.idea-lifestyle.net/portal
#
Certificate for TLS
New certificates are created automatically when you add a custom domain. Workato manages certificates to enable HTTPS on the custom domains that you add.
#
Certificate renewals
Custom domain certificates automatically renew one month before the set expiration date.
Workato manages the renewal process with
Let's Encrypt
(opens new window)
. The new certificate request for the custom domain includes validating domain ownership through DNS records or other verification methods specified by Let's Encrypt. Workato automatically deploys the new certificate after Let's Encrypt issues it. This seamless transition ensures that your custom domain continues to operate over HTTPS without interruption or manual intervention required on your end.
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY AUTHORIZATION (CAA) RECORD
If you restrict the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are allowed to issue certificates for your site, the custom domain workflow fails when trying to issue a certificate for your custom domain.
Add a CAA record
(opens new window)
for Let's Encrypt's domain name
letsencrypt.org
to resolve this.

Custom domain and email server
page to check on the status.

Custom email server
Workato allows you to send emails from your Workflow apps using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This feature enables you to send emails from addresses like
{username}@{customerdomain}.com
instead of the default
[email protected]
. By using your organization's email server, such as Exchange Online or Gmail, you can maintain consistency in your communications.
