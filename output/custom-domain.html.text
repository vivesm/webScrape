Custom Domain
Route Workato API endpoints through your own domain to expose Workato API endpoints under your own subdomain. For example, modify the endpoint to reflect your company's subdomain.
Original API URL:
https://apim.workato.com/boltco/sales-api/get-invoice
Custom domain URL:
https://api.boltcompany.com/sales-api/get-invoice
NOT CASE SENSITIVE
Custom domains in Workato are not case sensitive.

Configure a custom domain
VIRTUAL PRIVATE WORKATO (VPW) CUSTOMERS
This feature requires configuration steps that are specific to your Virtual Private Workato (VPW) instance.
If you are a VPW customer, refer to your VPW private documentation for the configuration details for your instances.
1
Prepare a registered domain and subdomain name. For more information on domain names, see the
ICANN documentation
(opens new window)
. For example,
blog.boltcompany.com
.
2
Go to
Tools
>
API Platform
>
Settings
>
Custom domain
in the Orchestrate platform and click
Register custom domain
.
Register custom domain
3
Enter your subdomain name and click
Add domain
.
Register a domain
Next, verify your custom domain by configuring the CNAME record with your domain host. The following steps use Cloudflare as an example.
4
Click
Add record
, select
CNAME
as the type, and provide the subdomain name. In this example, we create the subdomain
api
for domain
boltcompany.com
.
Create CNAME record with Cloudflare
5
Provide the target. Copy and paste
apim-custom.workato.com
.
USING ANOTHER DATA CENTER?
Workato allows users to host their recipes and API collection in
different data center for compliance
. If you are not using the US Data Center, please use an alternate target URL for the CNAME record.
EU Data Center:
apim-custom.eu.workato.com
JP Data Center:
apim-custom.jp.workato.com
SG Data Center:
apim-custom.sg.workato.com
AU Data Center:
apim-custom.au.workato.com

Click

.
Depending on the domain host, it might take up to an hour for the new CNAME record to propagate through the global domain name system. After verifying your custom domain's DNS, Workato will start generating a TLS certificate. It can take up to an hour for the certificate to be issued and ready for use. Refresh the
Custom domains
page to check on the status.
CAN THE ORIGINAL ENDPOINT NAME BE USED?
The original API endpoint continues to work in parallel with your custom domain.
Requests to custom domains are routed to a
specific set of IP addresses
.
#
Certificate for TLS
The default domain is
workato.com
when you use Workato’s API platform. Custom domains are supported. New certificates are created automatically when you add a custom domain.
Workato manages API certificates to enable HTTPS on the custom domains that you add.
#
Certificate renewals
Custom domain certificates automatically renew one month before the set expiration date.
Workato manages the renewal process with
Let’s Encrypt
(opens new window)
. The new certificate request for the custom domain includes validating domain ownership through DNS records or other verification methods specified by Let’s Encrypt. Workato automatically deploys the new certificate after it is issued by Let's Encrypt. This seamless transition ensures that your custom domain continues to operate over HTTPS without interruption or manual intervention required on your end.
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY AUTHORIZATION (CAA) RECORD
If you restrict the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are allowed to issue certificates for your site, the custom domain workflow fails when trying to issue a certificate for your custom domain. Add a CAA record for Let's Encrypt's domain name
letsencrypt.org
to resolve this.
