Custom field validation
Workflow apps offers custom client-side field validation for specific page components. Custom client-side field validation in Workflow apps ensures data accuracy, prevents errors, and enhances workflow efficiency. It guides the end-users of your apps to enter data correctly, helps in regulatory compliance, and provides flexibility for customization. This ultimately enables you to create more reliable and streamlined business processes.
Workato recommends that you configure your recipes to perform additional validation in business-critical fields. Because data table entries can be edited directly in columns, they are not eligible for client-side validations.
#
How it works
You can configure custom client-side field validation for page components manually in the
properties panel
of the page editor. Note that this type of validation is separate from the
built-in validation
of user input it offers for many other
page components
.
Workflow apps offers the following types of custom client-side field validation:
Limit input length
Limit input value
Pattern matching with regex
#
Compatible components
The following table describes which page components are compatible with each custom client-side validation type.

#
Limit input length
Determine the minimum and maximum character length for page components.
#
How to limit input length
Complete the following steps to limit input length for short answer components:
1
In Workato, navigate to your Workflow app.
2
Select the page where you plan to add custom field validation. Select the page to open the page editor.
3
Drag and drop the
Short answer
component from the
Content and background
panel onto your page.
4
Customize this component using the
Properties
panel.
View complete list of short answer component properties
Editable
Determine whether the text is editable, read-only, or editable only under the conditions you specify. This property is useful for gathering user input or creating read-only fields. For example, if you are creating a
submission form
you would make most, if not all, of the page components editable and then make the corresponding
approval form
read-only.
Yes
Select
Yes
for components that you plan to use to collect user input.
No
Select
No
for components that you plan to be read-only.
Conditional
Configure an
IF
condition to make this component editable only under the conditions you specify. You can chain multiple
IF
conditions using
AND
or
OR
. For example, you can configure an input field to be editable by a specific user only during a specific workflow stage. Configuring an
IF
condition in Workflow apps is similar to adding an
IF condition
to a recipe workflow. Use the
Page data
modal to map data related to app users, requests, and page components into your
IF
condition.
Save user input to data column/ display from data column
When this component is editable, this property specifies which data column Workato uses to populate the input component and capture user input. When this component is read-only, this property specifies from which column Workato displays data.
Visible
This property determines the visibility of input components. The following options are available.
Always show
When set to
Always show
, input components are always visible.
Conditional
Configure an
IF
condition to make this component visible only under the conditions you specify. You can chain multiple
IF
conditions using
AND
or
OR
. For example, you can configure input components to be visible to a specific user only during a specific workflow stage. Configuring an
IF
condition in Workflow apps is similar to adding an
IF condition
to a recipe workflow. Use the
Page data
modal to map data related to app users, requests, and page components into your
IF
condition.
Input type
This field allows you to change the type of user input you plan to collect. For example, if you add an
Email
component to your page, and later decide to collect phone numbers instead, this field enables you to do so without adding an entirely new component to your page.
Label
Determine a label for this input field.
Hint
Provide a hint to help users understand the type of input you plan to collect.
Placeholder
Provide a placeholder value for this input field.
Required
Determine whether users must provide input for this field. The following options are available:
Yes
When
Yes
, users must provide input for this field.
No
When
No
, providing input for this field is optional.
Conditional
Configure an
IF
condition to make this component required only under the conditions you specify. You can chain multiple
IF
conditions using
AND
or
OR
. For example, you can configure an input field to require user input by a specific user only during a specific workflow stage. Configuring an
IF
condition in Workflow apps is similar to adding an
IF condition
to a recipe workflow. Use the
Page data
modal to map data related to app users, requests, and page components into your
IF
condition.
Limit input length
Use this toggle to limit the amount of user input this component can accept. You can customize the minimum and maximum characters allowed.
Minimum length
Specify the minimum amount of characters this field can accept.
Maximum length
Specify the maximum amount of characters this field can accept.
Match regular expression
Use this toggle to create a rule that user input must match the
regex (regular expression)
you specify. This configuration option is only available for
Short answer
components.
Regular expression
Provide the regex that user input must match. Refer to our
Custom field validation
guide for more information.
Error message if expression not met
Enter a custom error message. Workflow apps displays this message to end-users when user input does not match the regex you specify.
5
In the
Rules
section of the
Properties
panel, toggle
Limit input length
.
6
Customize the minimum and maximum characters allowed by configuring the following fields:
Minimum length
Specify the minimum amount of characters this field can accept.
Maximum length
Specify the maximum amount of characters this field can accept.
For example, we've configured this page to accept a minimum of five characters and a maximum of sixteen characters.

to preview and test your configurations. You can preview your page using existing columns from your data table or using an empty record to enter custom input.
When user input doesn't meet the minimum length you've specified, Workato displays an error message:
Error message: Minimum 5 characters (2 characters short)
When user input exceeds the maximum length you've specified, Workato displays an error message:
Error message: Maximum is 15 characters (5 characters exceeded)
#
Limit input value
Use this feature to limit the values that Number components can accept.

How to limit input value
Complete the following steps to limit input length for
Number
components:
1
In Workato, navigate to your Workflow app.

Practical regex examples
The following examples demonstrate how to use regex to match specific strings of text, including SSNs (Social Security Numbers), IBAN (International Banking Account Numbers), and ZIP Codes.
#
IBAN (International Banking Account Number)
IBAN (International Banking Account Number) formats vary by country. The following regex pattern that covers many standard IBAN formats:
^
[
A
-
Z
]
{2}
[
0
-
9
]
{2}
[
A
-
Z
0
-
9
]
{1,30}
$
#
SSN (Social Security Number)
The following pattern matches US SSNs (Social Security Numbers).
^
\d
{3}
-
\d
{2}
-
\d
{4}
$
#
ZIP Codes/postal codes
#
US ZIP Codes
US ZIP Codes can be either five digits or nine digits (ZIP+4 format). The following regex covers both:
^
\d
{5}
(
-
\d
{4}
)
?
$
#
EU postal codes
Postal codes can vary widely across EU countries. The following regex is configured to cover a broad range, but may not cover all postal codes in the EU:
^
\d
{4,5}
(
[
-
\s
]
?
\d
{3}
)
?
$
#
Japan postal codes
Japanese postal codes are formatted as three digits, a hyphen, and four digits:
^
\d
{3}
-
\d
{4}
$
#
Singapore postal codes
Singapore postal codes are six digits:
^
\d
{6}
$
#
Australian postal codes
Australian postal codes are four digits:
^
\d
{4}
$
