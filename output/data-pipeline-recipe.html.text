What is a Data Pipeline recipe?
A Data Pipeline recipe simplifies the setup, management, and monitoring of your data pipelines. This enables you to manage data movement across all objects from a source to a specific destination in a single recipe.
Data Pipeline recipes can ingest thousands of objects from a source application or file system to a destination data warehouse in a single step, matching schemas as it moves data.
This recipe uses a
bulk extraction and load approach
. This ensures a complete sync of the source data to the destination while maintaining data integrity.
