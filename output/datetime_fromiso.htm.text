For example,  
2016-09-07T16:55:25.670Z
.
Text
epoch
Date and time in epoch format. Seconds are counted since January 1, 1970, midnight UTC/GMT, not counting leap seconds.
Text

Date and time in milliseconds counted since January 1, 1970, midnight in the UTC/GMT time zone.
Text

Text
custom
Text of the date in the format specified by the 
format
 and

 input fields.
Text
The input fields 
format
 and 
zone
 work only with the output field 
custom
.
See the 
Date to Text
 function for details and examples of how to generate custom formatted dates and times as text. Using the 
custom
 output field is equivalent to using the 
Date To Text
 function.
To convert a Unix time to a date, use the 
Text to Date
 function instead of 
Convert
.
Example
If the 
start
 is 
2016-09-07T00:01:25.670Z
, then:
date
 is 
2016-09-07T00:01:25.670Z
iso
 is 
2016-09-07T00:01:25Z
epoch
 is 
1473206485
unix

See the 
Date to Text
 function for examples for the 
custom
 output field. The 
custom
 output with the 
format
 and 
zone
 inputs works the same as the 
Date To Text
 function.
