Common recipe errors
This page provides an overview of the common types of recipe errors you may encounter when using Workato. Understanding the distinction between design-time and run-time errors is crucial for accurate troubleshooting and ensures that your recipes function optimally.
#
Design-time vs. run-time errors
Design time
is the phase before you click
Start recipe
. During this phase, you can identify and resolve misconfigurations, missing fields, and validation issues.
Run time
begins when the recipe is actively running. Addressing design-time issues prevents job errors during run time. Recognizing whether an error starts in design or run time helps you find the root cause and ensures smooth recipe operation.
#
Design-time errors
Design-time errors occur during the recipe creation phase and must be resolved to ensure the recipe can start and run correctly. These include issues such as unestablished connectivity, empty actions, and incorrect formulas.
For more information, refer to our
Design-time errors
documentation.
#
Run-time errors
Run-time errors occur during the execution of a recipe and can disrupt its successful completion. These include misconfigured triggers, internal application errors and rate limit issues.
For more information, refer to our
Run-time errors
documentation.
