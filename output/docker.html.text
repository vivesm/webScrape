On-premise agent deployment using Docker image
This page provides steps on how to deploy an on-premise agent using Docker image.
PREREQUISITE
Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.
#
Step 1: Retrieve the On-prem agent
Complete the following steps to retrieve the On-prem agent:
1
Sign in to your Workato account. The Orchestrate platform displays by default.
2
Go to
Tools > On-prem groups
and select your On-prem group.
3
Click
Add on-prem agent
.
4
Provide a descriptive agent name in the
Agent name
field, and select
Docker
as the operating system (OS) in the
Operating system
field.
Choose OS
5
Copy and paste the Docker pull command provided by Workato into your terminal to pull the Docker image from the repository:
docker
pull
"daa34553.workato.com/semi-public/amd64/workato-agent:<version>"
;
Pull Docker image
#
Step 2: Activate and run the On-prem agent
Complete the following steps to activate and run the On-prem agent:
1
Copy and paste the activation command provided by Workato. The command should look similar to the example below, with
"secret-agent-code"
replaced by your unique activation code.
Running this command automatically generates the agent key and certificate within the agent container. Note that the activation code is valid for one hour.
docker
run
-it
-e
WORKATO_AGENT_ACTIVATION_CODE
=
"secret-agent-code"
"daa34553.workato.com/semi-public/amd64/workato-agent:
<
version
>
ALLOW TRAFFIC TO WORKATO FROM YOUR SERVER
You must allow traffic to Workato from your server. Refer to
security allowlists
for more information.
Activate agent and run docker image
2
Optional. Run the following command if you plan to export your agent certificate and key to a directory on your host machine:
docker
run
-it
--rm
-v
/some/host/directory/containing/conf:/var/lib/workato-agent/conf
-e
WORKATO_AGENT_ACTIVATE_ONLY
=
y
-e
WORKATO_AGENT_ACTIVATION_CODE
=
"secret-agent-code"
"daa34553.workato.com/semi-public/amd64/workato-agent:<version>"
;
3
Optional. If you already have a valid agent key and certificate, run the OPA docker using the following command:
docker
run
-d
-v
/some/host/directory/containing/conf:/var/lib/workato-agent/conf
"daa34553.workato.com/semi-public/amd64/workato-agent:<version>"
;
4
Click
Test agent
after the agent starts to verify that the connection is successful.
Test agent
PRIVATE KEY
Workato does not have access to your private key file,
cert.key
, in the OPA
conf
folder. Ensure you protect this file from unauthorized access.
