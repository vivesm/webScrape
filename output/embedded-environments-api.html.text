Environments
#
Embedded Environments APIs
Embedded APIs
are fully compatible with Embedded Environments. You can continue to use the same Embedded API across all environments by targeting the appropriate workspace ID. When provisioning Environments for an existing Embedded Customer, their original workspace ID becomes the Development workspace ID, and two new IDs are generated for the TEST and PROD Environments.
#
Embedded APIs with and without Environments
The base URL for all Embedded API interactions is:
.../api/managed_users/
Append the
managed_user_id
to this base URL to interact with a specific customer. This allows you to manage each environment for customers with Environments provisioned by pointing to each workspace ID. If the customer doesn't have Environments provisioned, you can use the URL
/api/managed_users/:managed_user_id
to interact with a specific customer.
WORKSPACE ID REPRESENTATION FOR PROVISIONED AND NON-PROVISIONED ENVIRONMENTS
The
managed_user_id
represents the Workspace ID when Environments is not provisioned.
The
managed_user_id
represents each environment ID (Development, Test, or Production) when Environments is provisioned. To find the
managed_user_id
: click
Workspace Admin > Settings > Workspace ID
.
Use the following API endpoints to target a specific environment within a customer's account:
Development environment:
/api/managed_users/:managed_user_id_dev
Test environment:
/api/managed_users/:managed_user_id_test
Production environment:
/api/managed_users/:managed_user_id_prod
When you provision Environments for an existing customer, their original
:managed_user_id
is designated for the Development environment (
:managed_user_id_dev
). New unique identifiers are generated for the Test and Production environments (
:managed_user_id_test
and
:managed_user_id_prod
, respectively). This ensures that each environment is independently accessible and manageable through the API, providing precise control over the deployment and operation of integrations across different development stages.
#
Provision Environments programmatically
You can provision the Environments feature programmatically for new and existing managed customers. Refer to the
Embedded APIs Environments
section for more information.
#
How to get the correct ID
You can retrieve the IDs for your customers' environments using the
Get List Of Customers API
.
When listing your customers, those with Environments provisioned return the new property
environments
with the PROD and TEST environments IDs.
#
Sample request
curl
-X
GET https://www.workato.com/api/managed_users
\
-H
'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>'
#
Response
{
{
"id"
:
29727
,
//this is the used_id for a customer without ENVs
"external_id"
:

...
}
,
}
#
External IDs for environments
You can also specify unique external IDs for each of your customers' environments. External IDs enable you to manage customers programmatically in the same way as you do for customers without Environments.
To add an external ID, you can either
Update the customer through the API
or add it through the UI:
1
Navigate to
Manage customers
.
2
Click
Settings > External IDs
.
#
Exclusive development environment access
Certain API endpoints, designed for development activities like collaborator management, are exclusively accessible within the Development environment. An error displays if you try to access these endpoints from your TEST or PROD environments.
For example:
#
Sample request
curl
-X
POST https://www.workato.com/api/managed_users/:managed_user_id_test
\
-H
'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>'
#
Response
{
"message"
:
"Not Available for Environment"
}
