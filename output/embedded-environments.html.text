Environments for Embedded customers
The Embedded
Environments
feature integrates dedicated environments into your Workato workspace, allowing you to access all customer environments under the same Admin workspace. Embedded Environments aggregates usage metrics for your customers.
Your customers have built-in access to
Development, Test, and Production
environments when the Environments feature is provisioned. You can define
different roles
to a single collaborator in each environment. Note that each environment operates as a
separate and isolated workspace
, essential for maintaining the integrity and independence of development, testing, and production activities. Each environment includes its own set of resources, ensuring a clear distinction and operational independence between them. These resources include:
Assets
Members
Projects
Recipes
Connections
Lookup tables
Other asset types
Environments for Embedded customers is compatible with
Recipe Lifecycle Management
API and UI tools.
WHO CAN USE THIS FEATURE?
The Embedded Environments feature is gradually being rolled out for Embedded partners. You can provision Environments for selected customers or across your entire customer base. Note that Admin workspaces are excluded from this feature. Contact your Customer Success Manager to access Environments. Embedded Environments is available at no additional cost.
#
Embedded Environments architecture
The Admin workspace is the top level in the Embedded Environments architecture. Embedded Customer (EC) workspaces (with or without) Environments provisioned are nested beneath the Admin workspace.

Environments
Customer workspaces with the Environments feature provisioned have the following environments:
Environment
Description
Development
The Development environment serves as the primary area for the entire development process. Equipped with exclusive features, it allows for recipe development, project deployment to subsequent environments, and team and account settings management. The collaborators and API clients tabs are only accessible in the Development Environment, located under the workspace admin section.
Test
The Test environment is used to perform recipe testing, quality assurance reviews, and user acceptance testing.
Production
The Production environment is where automated processes are deployed after being tested, reviewed, and approved.
#
Deployment
You can deploy projects from the Development environment to the Test environment and from the Development environment to the Production environment.
