HMAC
The 
HMAC
 function card hashes input text, together with a secret key, using a cryptographic hash algorithm. 
The format of the resulting hash can be Base64, hex, or binary, depending on the specified output parameter.
Input
Field
Definition
Type
Required
algorithm
        Select the cryptographic hash algorithm to use:
md5
sha1
sha256
sha384
sha512
Dropdown
FALSE
key
                            Text to use as the secret cryptographic key.
This key, along with the algorithm, is necessary to validate the hash.
String
TRUE
data
Text string to be hashed.
This function only supports UTF-8 strings. The input string can't include any decimal, hexadecimal, binary, or ASCII characters.
String
TRUE
digest
        Select the output formatting for the resulting hash:
base64
hex
binary
Dropdown
FALSE
Output
Field
Definition
Type
output
Encoded string of your input data.
String
You can use the result of the 
output
 field wherever text can be sent. 
To validate the hash, you need the correct algorithm and secret key.
Example
Input
algorithm
: 
sha256
key
: 
my secret key
data
: 
My secret message!
digest
: 
base64
