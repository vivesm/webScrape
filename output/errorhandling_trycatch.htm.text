If Error
This function allows you to specify alternate actions to handle an error without stopping your flow.
The 
If Error
 function appears as a container in a flow where you can specify the following options:
Try
: Run one or more actions or functions.
If Error
: Specify alternate actions or functions to run if an error occurs in any of the steps in the 
Try
 section.
Outputs
: The flow can use the optional output fields  in subsequent steps. The value assigned to each output depends on whether an error occurred.
Use the dropdown menu to switch between the 
Try
 steps and 
If Error
 steps.
Try
When you add a new 
If Error
 container to a flow, you must first define the steps in the 
Try
 section. These steps consist of one or more actions or functions to run. You can add cards to this container just as you would elsewhere in a flow.
To add error handling to an existing set of steps in your flow, insert the 
If Error
 card into the flow after the cards that you want in your 
Try
 block. Then drag the existing cards in one by one, starting with the rightmost card.
To retry a step in your flow automatically before manually fixing an error, see 
Set error handling for cards in flows
.
If Error
The 
If Error
 block contains the steps that you want to take to handle an error. You can add actions or functions just as you would elsewhere in a flow.
To avoid parsing errors caused by complex error handling, 
Okta
 recommends a limit of no more than three nested 
If Error
 blocks.
An error object is added to each 
If Error
 block.  This object contains the following details of the error in the 
Try
 block that results in a switch to the 
If Error
 block:
message
: Text of the error message, when available.
code
: Error code, for example, 
500
.
method
: ID for the step where the error occurred.
flo
: ID of the flow.
execution
: ID of a specific execution of the flow. You can use these values in your error handling steps. For example, you can send an email with details of the error. Or, if it's an expected error, conditionally check if the flow should proceed.
Return
 and 
Continue If
 cards typically end a flow but behave differently when inside a 
Try
 or 
If Error
 block. Think of 
Try
 or 
If Error
 blocks as anonymous helper flows. Just like when you call a helper flow, a 
Return
 card returns you to the parent. So, adding a 
Return
 or 
Continue If
 (when false) card inside a 
Try
 or 
If Error
 block proceeds to the step immediately after the 
If Error
 container. 
If you want to halt the flow rather than continue, use a 
Return Error
, 
Return Error If
, or a 
Continue If
 card outside the 
If Error
 block.
Outputs
You can drag outputs from cards that run before the 
If Error
 function into a 
Try
 or 
If Error
 block. However, you can't drag outputs from inside the 
Try
 or 
If Error
 block to cards that are run after the 
If Error
 function. This is because a step from inside a 
Try
 or 
If Error
 may not always run. To avoid this, use the optional 
Outputs
 feature.
To access the outputs, click 
View Outputs
 on the top-right of the 
If Error
 container. This opens up a pane to the right of the 
Try
 and 
If Error
 blocks.
Click to add an output. You can type the name and choose the type. Two new fields appear beneath each output.
Drag an output from the 
Try
 block to one of these  fields. This output is used when an error doesn't occur.
Drag an output from the 
If Error
 block to the other field. This output is used when an error occurs.
You can then map the outputs from this pane to subsequent steps in the flow.
