Saving and reviewing flow data is critical for operational success within 
Okta Workflows
. Preserving the records of your flow executions provides you with valuable insights:
Identify and diagnose error conditions in new and existing flows to ensure seamless operations.
Retrace and analyze executed flows to highlight potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
Facilitate auditing of your flows to maintain compliance  to internal policies and external regulations.

Save flow data to execution history
 allows 
Okta
 to record the specific data passing through each card during execution. After the flow  execution, you can review and analyze the  values for every card in your flow. 
Flow metadata:

 records metadata associated with each execution event. This includes vital information  such as the type of flow, the execution timestamp, and the final execution status.
Access recorded
