Export and import flows
You can export and import single flows, or a folder containing multiple flows. The export and import features enable you to share flows and tables between multiple 
Okta
 orgs, or share  them with other people outside your org.
If you only want to make a copy of a folder or your  flows inside a folder, use the 
Duplicate a folder
 feature.
Single flows
To export or import a single flow within your org, complete the following steps:
Export a flow
In the 
Workflows Console
, select the folder containing the flow you want to export.
Click the 
Export
 icon on the flow. 
If your folder displays your flows in a list view, click the gear icon on the flow, and then click 
Export
. 
When you click 
Download
, the flow is exported and saved to your local system as a 
.flow
 file.
You can also use the 
Export Flow
 function card  to export a flow as a JSON object.
Import a flow
In the 
Workflows Console
, select the folder where you want to place the imported flow.
From the folder's dropdown 
Actions
 menu, click 
Import
.
Drag and drop your 
.flow
 file into the dialog, or click 
Choose file from computer
 to browse your local filesystem. The file import begins immediately.
Folders
To export or import a folder within your org, complete the following steps:
Export a folder
To export an entire folder, complete the following steps: 
On the 
Flows
 page of the 
Okta
Workflows Console
, select the folder you want to export.
From the folder's 
Actions
 dropdown  menu, select 
Export
. 
In the 
Export folder
 dialog, you can choose one of two options:
Export the entire folder tree, including the content from all nested subfolders
Export just the contents of the current folder
Click 
Export
 to start the export process.
Click 
Download
 to save the exported 
.folder
 file to your local filesystem. This file contains all exported flows, tables, and subfolders. 
The export function removes all connection information and table data. If you import this file later, you must  recreate or assign connections to use the flows again. However, if you import the file into your original 
Okta
 org, you can reapply your existing connections to the cards in those flows.
The export function does maintain links between objects referenced by the flows. 
For example, if a flow calls a helper flow to process a list, the link between that parent and helper flows is kept. 
However, if the exported folder contains references to objects that weren't included in the folder, 
Okta
 warns you that there are flows with missing references. When you import this file, 
Okta
 requires you to recreate the referenced objects for the flows.
You can also use the
Export Folder
 function card to export a folder as a single JSON object.
Import a folder
Imported flows appear as new flows in a folder. Since the export action doesn't retain connection information, you need to restore all card connections after you import the flows.
For tables, the export action doesn't include any of the original table data. The import action recreates all tables according to the table schema listed in the export file, but the tables are initially empty. The limit of 100 tables in a folder remains.
If any of the imported flows refer to a flow that wasn't included in the export (for example, a helper flow called to handle  a list), you must specify a replacement flow to complete the import.
To import an 
Okta Workflows
.folder
 file, complete the following steps:
On the 
Flows
 page of the 
Okta
Workflows Console
, select the folder where you want to place the imported flows.
Click the 
Actions
 dropdown menu for the folder and select 
Import
.
Drag and drop your file into the dialog, or click 
Choose file from computer
 link to browse your local file system for the file.
Click 
OK
.
Okta
 imports the content to the current folder, unless the import action would exceed the maximum folder depth of five levels. If this scenario arises, 
Okta
 provides the option to import the contents as a top-level folder instead.
When importing, 
Okta
 preserves the export locations of any subfolders, along with their flows and tables.
