Use the Download function card in a flow
Use the 
Download
 function card to download any file, such as an image or document file, that you can access through a URL in your browser.
To see the field inputs and outs for this function card, see 
Download
.
File functions don't support shareable links such as those from 
Box
, 
OneDrive
, or 
Google Drive
.
Enter the URL including the protocol, either 
http://
 or 
https://
, in the 
URL
 field.
Optional. Use the 
Query
 section to build a query string.
For example, if you wanted to download a file from 
https://www.example.com/download?filename=foo.txt
, then you can express this in one of two ways:
Enter the entire string in the 
URL
 field.
Set the URL to 
https://www.example.com/download
, then create an input file name in the 
Query
 section, and enter a value of 
foo.txt
. This method is easier when the value of the file name comes from a previous step in the flow. You can drag the field into the input.
Optional. Set headers in the request. 
For example, if the site requires authorization, then add an 
Authorization: Bearer {my-token}
 header 
Add an authorization key to the 
Headers
 section.
Set its value to 
Bearer {my-token}
.
You can also set a 
Content-type: application/image
 header in a similar manner.
Optional. Drag the ID value from the 
File Content
 output field to the 
File
 input of another card, such as a 
Box
 upload card.
