Multipart Upload
Upload a file from the Workflows file system to a web service, using HTTP or HTTPS, using multipart form-data. 
You may need to obtain the required input field data from a third-party service. 
The output depends on the response from the service. To access a particular response properly, create an output with the same name as the key in the response object.
File functions don't support shareable links such as those from 
Box
, 
OneDrive
, or 
Google Drive
.
