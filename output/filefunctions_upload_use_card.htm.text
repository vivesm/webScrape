Use the Upload function card in a flow
Use the Upload function card to upload any file, such as an image or document file, from the Workflows file system.
To see the field inputs and outputs for this function card, see 
Upload
.
File functions do not support shareable links such as those from Box, OneDrive, or Google Drive.
Identify the file to upload: Drag an existing 
File
 type 
(File Contents
 field) from a previous card in the flow. For example, use file contents from a download card from another cloud service.
Specify the URL, including the 
http://
 or 
https://
 part and any query string parameters, in the 
URL
 input field.
Select the HTTP method (PUT or POST) and set any headers required by the service.
Typically, there will be one or more headers required, especially for authentication.
For example, if the site requires authorization, you could add a header 
Authorization: Bearer my-token
 by adding an Authorization key to the Headers section and setting its value to 
Bearer my-token
.  You can also set 
Content-type: application/image
 similarly.
The output is dependent on the response from the service.  To access a particular response properly, create an output with the same name as the key in the response object.
