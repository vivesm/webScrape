Pause
This function card pauses a flow and returns the inputs using the interface that initiated the flow, along with the 
Execution ID
 of the flow that is needed in the resume request.
Resume a flow
To resume the flow, follow these steps:
Call the flow again with a specific URL endpoint, but append the 
Execution ID
 of the execution that needs to resume. The endpoint is similar to the one that invokes the flow.
You can find the endpoint on the 
API Endpoint
 card's 
Event Settings
 page, but replace 
invoke
 with 
resume
.
After you resume the flow, append 
/{{EXECUTION_ID}}
 to the URL.
For example, if the API Endpoint is the following: 
{{<api_endpoint>}}/flo/5f023d66e31808a8ce04954078fabc99/invoke
, the endpoint that resumes the flow is 
{{<api_endpoint>}}/flo/5f023d66e31808a8ce04954078fabc99/resume/1234SampleExecutionID0987
.
See 
Resume a paused flow
.
The execution ID for a given execution can be found in two places:
On the 
API Endpoint
 card. One of the default output fields for every monitor event is the 
Execution ID
. You can use this value as an input to another card. This is a good method for programmatically resuming the flow.
In the response from the request to the API endpoint. The response includes the 
Execution ID
 in the headers, so you can also retrieve this ID from the service that originally called the flow.
The 
Pause
 function card only works when it's used in flows that are resumed programmatically. If you want to pause a flow for a specific delay or until a specific time, use either a 
Wait For
 or 
Wait Until
 function card.
Input
Create a custom input field for each value that you want passed to the caller when the flow pauses.
Output
Create a custom output field that corresponds to each value that the caller passes back to the flow with the resume request.
To pass data to these output keys, submit them as JSON key and value pairs in the body of the request.
For example, if you have an output field with the name 
X
, then pass in 
X:Y
. This sends 
Y
 as the value returned by the 
X
 output key.
