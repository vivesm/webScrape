Return
This function card ends a flow and returns values to the caller of the flow.
Input
This card has no default input fields. To add input fields, create them manually on this card or drag and drop output fields from other cards.
Output
This card has no output fields. 
This function card behaves differently when placed inside a 
If/ElseIf
 or 
If/Error
 block. 
Consider those blocks as representing anonymous helper flows. Similar to when you call a helper flow, this function card returns you to the parent. Placing this function card inside one of those block sends you to the step immediately after the container. 
Use a 
Continue If
 function after the 
If/ElseIf
 block to stop a flow under normal conditions. You can use a 
Return Error
 or 
Return Error If
 card instead, but those options generate an error when the flow halts.
