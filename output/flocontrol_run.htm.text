Call Flow Async
This function card starts another flow and then continues without waiting for that flow to finish. You can use multiple 
Call Flow Async
 cards if you want to start different sets of actions that run in parallel.
Because the main flow doesn't wait for the called flow to finish, you can't return specific values from that helper flow. If you need returned values, use 
Call Flow
 instead.
