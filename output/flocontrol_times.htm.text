Repeat
This function card runs a helper flow a specified number of times.
To use this function card, you must call a helper flow that contains the steps that you want to run repeatedly. Your helper flow can receive the current loop count through the 
Index
 field in the 
Context
 section of the helper flow card. For example, the first time the helper flow runs, the value of the 
Index
 field is 
0
. The second time the value is 
1
 and then 
2
 for the third time, incrementing after each execution of the helper flow.
