Export Folder
Export a folder containing one or more flows as a JSON file.
Your Workflows subscription determines the maximum number of flows that you can export. Each flow inside a folder counts as one towards the maximum limit.
The number of exported flows can't exceed the assigned limit. Otherwise the export fails and no flows are exported.
Your org's export capacity resets every 15 minutes.
If you only want another local copy of your folder, you can choose to 
Duplicate a folder
 instead.
