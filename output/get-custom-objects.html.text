Workday
#
Get custom object action
You can extend Workday business objects by configuring custom objects. These custom objects are based standard Workday business objects and can be used to store additional information. This allows you to capture data unique to your organization in Workday. This action allows you to retrieve a custom object value of a specific Workday object.
#
Example
For example, we are setting a new onboarding process for our employee. Every employee has to undergo a drug test. On Workday, we set up a custom object called
drugTested
under the parent object
Workers
.
We can use this action to check if a drug test has been conducted for this worker.
#
Inputs
Get custom objects action
Input field
Description
Alias
Select the custom object that you want to retrieve. This is the Web service alias.
Parent object ID
The Workday ID of the parent object that you are selecting.
Custom object fields
Define the fields in this custom object. If left blank, it will retrieve all fields with their default names.
Is multi-instanced?
Custom objects in Workday can be single-instanced or multi-instanced. An example of multi-instanced custom object is a worker's COVID19 vaccination records, whereas an example of single-instanced custom object is whether worker is allowed to work from home. Set this to Yes if custom object being fetched is multi-instanced.
