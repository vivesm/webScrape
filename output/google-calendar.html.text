Service account authentication
A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.
Service accounts provide the following benefits:
Continuous operation:
Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
Dedicated permissions:
Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
Dedicated API quotas:
You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.
