Google Workspace
Google Workspace
(opens new window)
, formerly known as G Suite, is a collection of cloud computing, productivity, and collaboration tools developed by Google.
Workato enables you to add, delete, update, fetch, or search for objects, such as users, groups, or roles. For example, when onboarding new employees, you can use the Google Workspace connector to automatically add their details to Google Workspace.
#
API version
The Google Workspace connector uses the
Google Admin SDK
(opens new window)
to connect to admin services.
#

Service account authentication
A Google service account is a specialized Google account associated with a Google Cloud Project (GCP) that can run API requests on your behalf.
Service accounts provide the following benefits:
Continuous operation:
Service accounts ensure that operations continue even if individual user permissions change.
Dedicated permissions:
Service accounts can only access projects that you share with them.
Dedicated API quotas:
You can manage a service account's API quotas through GCP and request quota increases directly from Google.
Refer to the
Google service account documentation
(opens new window)
to learn more about service accounts.
