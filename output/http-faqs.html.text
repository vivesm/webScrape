Why am I getting a 307 Temporary Redirect error when enabling automatically follow redirects?
If you encounter a
307 Temporary Redirect
error, note that automatic redirects are not enabled by default for HTTP methods such as
POST
and
PUT
. However, they are enabled for
GET
and
HEAD
requests. This behavior aligns with the
RFC protocol guidelines on automatic redirects
(opens new window)
. The guidelines advise caution with automatic redirects for unsafe methods.
To handle these redirects, you can manually implement logic in your recipes. Use
error monitoring
to create your own
307
redirect handling. Then, use the
Location
header returned with the original call to manage the redirect effectively.
What should I do if I encounter a certificate verify failed error?
If you encounter a
certificate verify failed
error, it may be due to an incomplete certificate chain or untrusted self-signed certificates. Complete the following steps to resolve this issue:
1
Ensure you have the complete certificate chain. This includes the server certificate, intermediate certificates, and root certificate, with each separated by an empty line.
2
Input the entire chain into the
TLS server custom CA certificate
field in your HTTP connection settings.
Refer to the
HTTP SSL certificate verify failed troubleshooting guide
for more detailed instructions.
