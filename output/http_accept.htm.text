API Endpoint
The 
API Endpoint
 card allows you to create a flow that can be invoked through a URL.
The card only supports 
GET
 and 
POST
 request methods. Other request methods, such as 
HEAD
, aren't supported.
The 
Okta Workflows
 API doesn't allow authenticated cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for browser-initiated flow invocations. Any CORS preflight requests don't return the 
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
 header, and therefore cause a failure for any browser requests that include credentials. If you need to invoke an authenticated 
API Endpoint
 through a browser, send the request through an external backend proxy.
Input
This card has no input fields.
Output
The user creates the output fields for the API Endpoint card, using the following three categories.
Field
Definition
Type
raw
headers
Create explicitly named output fields (for example 
content-type
) to access the values contained within the header of the HTTP request. 
As headers are normally case insensitive,  enter the header keys you want to capture in all lowercase.
Object
body
Create explicitly named output fields  to access values contained within the body of the HTTP request. 
This is commonly used when activating a flow using a 
POST
 HTTP request.
Text
query
Create explicitly named output fields  to access any parameters sent within the URL string after the query parameter in the HTTP request. 
For example, if the invoking URL is 
https://example.com/example?name=john
, you can add a field called 
name
 to access to the value 
john
 contained within this field.
Don't use parameters  with an 
x-okta-workflows
 prefix to pass data to the rest of a flow when calling an 
API Endpoint
, as this prefix isn't available.
