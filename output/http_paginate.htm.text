Paginate
This function card is only available in 
Connector Builder
.
Use a helper flow to paginate through multiple pages of an HTTP response.
See the following topics for best practices and examples using the 
Paginate
 function card:
Paginate: set a maximum page index
Paginate: API endpoint
Overview
The internal paginate function acts like a "Do while" loop in that it checks for a condition to determine if a flow needs to stop looping.
When the loop starts, an object is passed into the 
object
 field of the function. A helper flow then manages the values within that object. As the values in that object are updated, they're returned to the function. If the stop condition isn't met, the object passes back into the helper flow with the updated values.
Proper use of the 
path
 field is important to the paginate function. If it isn't properly managed, the flow could run until it hits the maximum count of 5,000 iterations.
To stop the iteration, your flow must remove the 
path
 field from the object.
Input
Field
Definition
Type
Required
object
The object that passes through the helper flow.
This can hold any number of key and value pairs, such as 
offset
, 
page_index
, 
url
, or a list object used to collect records.
The object must contain a key that holds the break condition to tell the function when to stop iterating. The value of this key should be set to 
FALSE
 initially.
Object
TRUE
path
This field designates the key name within the 
object
 that the function must monitor so that it knows when to stop the loop.
This key is commonly named 
break
 and should be set to 
FALSE
 inside the object.
To stop the iteration, your helper flow must remove this 
path
 field  from the 
object
.
Text
TRUE
Helper Flow

object
 input.
