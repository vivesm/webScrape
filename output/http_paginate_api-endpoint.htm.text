Paginate: API endpoint
This function card is only available in 
Connector Builder
.
This example builds on the concepts and implementation introduced in 
Paginate: set a maximum page index
.
The specific behaviors of paginating against an API endpoint vary depending on the API.  For this example, consider a simple link header that includes a URL for the next page of records. 
To expand on the 
Paginate: set a maximum page index
 exercise, add some new key and value pairs to the pagination 
object
:
url
: This is the complete URL used to retrieve the first page of records. In many services, this contains both a limit and an offset value.
limit
: Determines how many records to retrieve, starting from the offset.
offset
: Position in the data set of the last record retrieved.
results_list
: This is an empty list of objects to which each page of new records is added.
Connection
: The connection information that is passed along to the helper flow. To include a connection, click 
Add event
 and select 
Action
.
The resulting 
object
 looks like:
Copy
{
  "page_index": 0,
  "max_page_index": 10,
  "url": "https://app.scaleft.com/v1/teams/demo/projects?limit=200&offset=0",
  "results_list": [],
  "break": false,
   "Connection":{
      "blob":{
         "api_key":"<apikeystring>"
      }
   }
}
Helper flow
The 
Paginate
 function requires a helper flow. The inputs defined in the helper flow  need to match the keys you defined in the pagination 
object
: 
page_index
max_page_index
break
url
results_list
Connection
Use the 
url
 value to call the service using the 
HTTP Raw Request
 function.  After you receive a response, the helper flow manages the 
url
 and 
results_list
 to prepare for the next iteration of the pagination function.  
Extract the 
link
 header from the 
headers
 object and the page of 
results
 from the 
body
 object using 
Get
 object cards.
After a page of results has been extracted from the response, it needs to be added to any existing results from previous pagination iterations using the 
List Union
 function. Then rebuild the pagination object with the new values collected within the helper flow.
The resulting 
object
 looks like:
Copy
{
  "page_index": 1,
  "max_page_index": 10,
  "break": false,
  "url": "https://app.scaleft.com/v1/teams/demo/projects?limit=200&offset=200",
  "results_list": [
    "1",
    "2",
    "3",
    "4",
    "5",
    "..."
  ],
  "Connection": {
    "blob": {
      "api_key": "<apikeystring>"
    }
  }
}
Finally, you need to determine how the API indicates that there are no more result pages  so the pagination should halt. For example,  the service might drop the 
link
 key from the header after the last page of results is sent.
Therefore, if the 
link
 key is missing or empty, then the 
break
 key must be removed from the pagination object using the 
Unset
 object function.  When the pagination object is returned to the parent flow without the 
break
 key, the pagination stops.
When you run the parent flow, the final 
object
 looks like the following:
Copy
{
  "page_index":6,
  "max_page_index":10,
  "url": "",
  "results_list":[
    "1",
    "2",
    "3",
    "4",
    "5",
    "6",
    "7",
    "8",
    "9",
    "10",
    "..."
  ],
  "Connection":{
    "blob":{
      "api_key":"<apikeystring>"
    }
  }
}
