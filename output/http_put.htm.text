Put
Performs an API Connector Put request, returning the result of this request and the response headers. On input, takes a required URL input and optional auth, header, body, and query inputs. Each optional input can either be modeled by a singular object-typed input or by multiple keys with the appropriate group attribute. On output, returns an object with two keys, headers and output. The output key contains the response body, and the headers key contains the response header. More detailed information can be accessed about these by using multiple keys with the appropriate grouping.
