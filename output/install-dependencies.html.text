SOAP
#
Install SOAP connector and dependencies
To install the SOAP connector and its dependencies, complete the following steps:
Step 1: Set up an on-prem agent (OPA)
Step 2: Install the OPA extension
Step 3: Install the SOAP connector
After you install these dependencies, you can
set up the connection
.
#
Step 1: Set up an on-prem agent (OPA)
Set up an on-prem agent (OPA)
. You can use either a
cloud profile
or
connection profile
, but note that in both cases, you must be able to manually edit the
config.yml
on the machine where the OPA is installed.
If you have already set up an OPA, proceed to
Step 2
.
#
Step 2: Install the OPA extension
After setting up the on-prem agent, complete the following steps to install the OPA extension:
Step 2.1: Locate the on-prem agent
Step 2.2: Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)
Step 2.3: Download the SOAP extension package
Step 2.4: Configure the OPA and the extension
Step 2.5: Restart the OPA
#
Step 2.1: Locate the on-prem agent
Locate the OPA directory on your filesystem. Typical locations are:
Unix-like operating systems:
/opt/workato
Windows:
C:\Program Files\Workato Agent
macOS:
Location varies.
$
ls
/opt/workato
bin conf jre lib lib_ext
The rest of this guide refers to this path as
$OPA
.
#
Step 2.2: Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)
First, check if the JDK is already installed. It must be version 17 or later. Typical locations are:
Linux:
/usr/lib/java
Ubuntu:
/usr/share/java/
Windows:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<release>
macOS:
Location varies based on distribution. Example:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
$
ls
/usr/lib/java
bin conf include jmods legal lib release
Ensure that the JDK installation is actually a JDK and not just a JRE, as this is required by Apache CXF. You can confirm this by checking for the
javac
binary:
$
ls
/usr/lib/java/bin/java*
bin/java bin/javac bin/javadoc bin/javap
If version 17+ of the JDK is not already installed, pick one of the many
JDK distributions
(opens new window)
and follow the installation instructions.
After installing the JDK, confirm the installation by listing the JDK folder:
$
ls
/path/to/jdk
bin conf include jmods legal lib release
#
Step 2.3: Download the SOAP extension package
The SOAP extension consists of two JAR files, packaged up and available for download at this URL:
https://workato-opa-extensions.s3.amazonaws.com/soap-extensions/soap-extension-latest.zip
(opens new window)
The following commands download and extract the package, moving the JAR files into the
$OPA/ext
folder. Note that
$OPA
represents the directory where the
on-prem agent is installed
.
$
curl
-o
soap-extension.zip https://workato-opa-extensions.s3.amazonaws.com/soap-extensions/soap-extension-latest.zip
$
unzip
soap-extension.zip
-d
$OPA
/ext
Confirm that both of the SOAP extension files are present in
$OPA/ext
:
$
ls
$OPA
/ext
|
grep
soap_extension
soap_extension.jar
soap_extension_client.jar
INSTALLING AN OLDER VERSION
If you need to install an older version of the SOAP extension, download the package from
this directory
(opens new window)
.
#
Step 2.4: Configure the OPA and the extension
The OPA configuration file is
$OPA/conf/config.yml
. To use the SOAP extension, you must update the configuration file according to the following instructions. This step applies whether the OPA is configured using a
cloud profile
or a
connection profile
.
1
Set the
classpath
to the path of the folder where the SOAP extension JAR files are located (typically
$OPA/ext
, with
$OPA
representing the directory where the
on-prem agent is installed
):
server
:
classpath
:
/opt/workato/ext
2
Register the SOAP extension:
extensions
:
soap
:
controllerClass
:
com.workato.extension.soap.ExtensionController
3
Make sure the OPA can find the JDK. By default, the SOAP extension will check for a JDK at the following locations:
JDK_HOME
environment variable
jdk.home
system property
Alternatively, set the JDK path explicitly:
extensions
:
soap
:
controllerClass
:
com.workato.extension.soap.ExtensionController
jdkHome
:
/path/to/jdk
#
Step 2.5: Restart the OPA
Follow the instructions in the OPA documentation on how to
stop
and
restart
the OPA.
#
Step 3: Install the SOAP connector
After you set up the OPA and SOAP extension, you can install the SOAP connector:
1
Log in in your Workato account.
2
Open
the connector in the community library
(opens new window)
.
3
Select
Install
.
4
Select
Release connector
.
