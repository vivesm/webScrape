IP allowlists
You can add IPs to the allowlist to prevent a malicious website from hijacking traffic to and from Workato.
VIRTUAL PRIVATE WORKATO (VPW) CUSTOMERS
This page provides general guidance for all Workato users. If you're a Virtual Private Workato (VPW) customer, refer to your private documentation for detailed configuration guidance specific to your instances.
#
Traffic from Workato
Traffic from Workato uses a unique set of IP addresses for each
data center
:
US data center
52.5.142.59, 34.226.132.221, 52.54.43.157
EU data center
3.65.225.246, 3.66.45.94, 18.198.249.58
JP data center
52.193.168.95, 13.113.30.44, 18.176.45.101
SG data center
13.215.42.244, 18.141.131.114, 52.74.226.121
AU data center
54.253.214.156, 13.236.115.248, 13.238.90.15
You can add these IP addresses to your application or firewall allowlist. Add all three IP addresses to ensure continuous access.
#
Example allowlist configuration
If you have a recipe that accesses a MySQL server that runs on an Amazon EC2 machine, with a special
integrationuser
user, you can run the following SQL command on your database to add Workato IP addresses to the allowlist:
GRANT
ALL
ON
db1
.
*
TO
'integrationuser'
@'52.5.142.59'
,
'integrationuser'
@'34.226.132.221'
,
'integrationuser'
@'52.54.43.157'
;

Traffic to Workato
#
On-premise agent
Workato's
on-premise agent
(OPA) provides secure selective access from Workato to customer-authorized on-prem apps, databases, and folders without having to open inbound ‘ports’ in the corporate firewall.
The OPA creates an outbound connection to the Workato cloud's on-premise gateways with the following domain names and IP addresses.
Each
data center
uses a unique set of IP addresses.
All Workato IP addresses use TCP port 443.
#
On-premise gateway addresses
If you are using OPA, add the following addresses to the allowlist. You must use both the
sg3
and
sg4
versions for load balancing.
United States: US data center

#
On-premise gateway IP address allowlist
If your organization has strict outbound traffic rules, you must enable OPA's access to the Workato cloud by adding it to the allowlist.
Firewall allowlists must allow outbound TCP connections from the OPA to port 443 based on the OPA version.
#
DNS resolution of FQDNs
Some organizations also restrict DNS resolutions on the machines and networks where the OPA runs. Ensure that the machine running OPA can resolve the IP addresses of the on-premise gateway's FQDNs.
#
Custom APIM domains
When using
custom domains
for API recipes, Workato routes client traffic to the following set of IP addresses. Each
data center
uses a unique set of IP addresses.
US data center
18.211.121.35, 34.232.254.255, 52.203.235.136
EU data center
3.127.182.4, 3.64.168.57, 3.66.114.67
JP data center
18.177.63.189, 52.194.114.232, 52.196.96.189
SG data center
18.136.28.27, 13.215.62.220, 13.214.235.186
AU data center
13.236.168.184, 13.238.90.32, 3.24.69.138
TLS AND HTTP STANDARDS
Refer to
Security
for information about supported TLS and HTTP standards for custom domain endpoints.
#
Static assets
Certain assets like recipe packages, profile photos, and customer adapter logos are served from a dedicated S3 bucket in your regional data center. Each
data center
has its own S3 bucket. Add the domain to your firewall allowlist based on the data center your account is hosted in.
US data center
FQDN
workato-assets.s3.amazonaws.com
EU data center
FQDN
workato-assets-eu-2.s3.amazonaws.com
JP data center
FQDN
workato-assets-jp.s3.amazonaws.com
SG data center
FQDN

Browsers, webhooks, API endpoints
All other traffic to Workato may be served by a different set of IP addresses, distinct from IP addresses discussed previously:
Browser-based user interaction and webhooks depend on the data center where your account is located:
US data center
https://www.workato.com
EU data center
https://app.eu.workato.com/
JP data center
https://app.jp.workato.com
SG data center
https://app.sg.workato.com/
AU data center
https://app.au.workato.com/
API endpoint requests depend on the data center where your account is located:
US data center
https://apim.workato.com/
EU data center
https://apim.eu.workato.com/
JP data center
https://apim.jp.workato.com/
SG data center
https://apim.sg.workato.com/
AU data center
