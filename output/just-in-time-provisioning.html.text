Enforce SSO with SAML

Team collaboration - Just in time provisioning
Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning eliminates the need for workspace admins to create Workato user accounts in advance on behalf of team members. When an employee signs up for a new Workato account using SAML SSO, they are automatically added to the organization's workspace.
Employee Email already Registered?
If an employee has an existing Workato account, Workato automatically adds them to the organization's workspace.
#
How to Enable JIT provisioning
You can enable SAML Just-In-Time provisioning in
Workspace admin
>
Settings
>
Authentication & provisioning
.

#
Customize JIT provisioning
You can customize JIT provisioning to relay user-specific information to Workato. Workato takes SAML attributes (for example,
workato_role
) and applies it to the provisioned Workato user. This enables you to provision new users with the appropriate information according to your workflow.
Workato supports the following attributes:
workato_email
,
workato_full_name
, and
workato_role
. If you do not configure these attributes, a default value is used.

#
Why customize JIT provisioning
Outside of the
Workato system roles
(
Admin
,
Analyst
, and
Operator
), you can configure custom roles with specific access to folders, or permissions to edit connections and recipes. This gives you more control to enforce security policies for Workato users within your organization.
Also, this eliminates the need to manually provision Workato users with the
appropriate access privileges
. This leads to reduced operations cost and smoother onboarding.
#
How to customize JIT provisioning
To assign user information during JIT provisioning, you first need complete the basic setup:
Enable
SAML based SSO
Enable
SAML Just-in-Time provisioning
in Workato
Configure the SAML attribute
on the SAML provider's application page.
(Optional) Create
custom roles
in Workato to enforce custom privileges. For example,
mktg_ops
role with only access to the Marketing folder within your workspace.
#
Configure Custom Attribute on SAML provider
Let's configure the SAML attributes for
workato_role
on Okta.
1
Navigate to
Directory > Profile Editor
.
2
Select your Workato SAML App profile.
3
Select
Add attribute
.
4
Fill in the
attribute
details.
Field
Description
Variable name
Give this attribute a descriptive name. In this example, we will use
workato_role
. This is case-sensitive.
Attribute members
For each attribute, use a descriptive
Display name
and provide Workato-specific values.
The
Value
corresponds to
Workato Roles
. In addition to custom roles, it is recommended that you also list out the default roles:
Admin
,
Analyst
,
Operator
. This is case-sensitive.
ENVIRONMENTS
If your organization uses environments, you can configure attribute statements to assign environment-specific roles as well. Simply add the additional attributes with the variable name set to
workato_role_test
for the
TEST
environment and
workato_role_prod
for the
PROD
environment. The default
workato_role
attribute maps to the
DEV
environment.
5
Locate the Workato
SAML app
.
6
Select
SAML settings > edit
.
7
Skip to
Configure SAML
.
8
Locate
App attribute statement
.
Field
Description
Name
Use
workato_role
. This is case-sensitive.
The
Name
is a Workato specific keyword. See
which fields are accepted
.
Value
Use
appuser.workato_role
.
The
value
is the
attribute you have just configured
.
Attribute Values for Different SAMLs
Each SAML uses a different syntax.
SAML application
Value
Okta
appuser.<attribute_name>
Onelogin
appuser.<attribute_name>
Microsoft Entra ID
user.<attribute_name>
Google IDP
<attribute_name>
9
Remember to save!
Lastly,
assign custom roles in your SAML application
.
#
Assign roles for workspace members
Let's assign custom SAML attributes for Workato on Okta.
1
When an employee is onboarded with Okta, select a value for
workato_role
.
2
Alternatively, for existing Okta users, assign
workato_role
on their profile page. This only applies if this Okta user
does not have
an existing Workato account.
3
Now, when a user logs in to Workato
using SSO
, the identity provider passes
workato_role
for this new user. For a new hire in the Marketing department, the provisioned Workato user is configured with the custom role
mktg_ops
.
#
JIT provisioning for users with access to multiple workspaces
In some situations, you may have one or more users that require access to multiple workspaces. For example, consider a scenario where your organization has separate Finance, Legal, and HR workspaces and you have one dedicated user who acts as a builder for all three workspaces. In this situation, the process of enabling JIT provisioning is the same, but Workato automatically adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to your organization's workspaces.
When you enable JIT provisioning for users and then give them access to multiple workspaces, Workato follows this typical flow.
1
Your organization's Workato administrator assigns the user access to the Workato application in your identity provider. This workspace, named Finance, is the first Workato workspace within your organization that the user has joined.
2
The user signs up for a new Workato account using SAML SSO with your organization's authentication provider.
3
Workato automatically creates an account for the user, using your organization's identity provider.
4
The user joins the Finance workspace.
5
Your organization's Workato administrator assigns the user to the HR Workspace in your identity provider, which they have never used before.
6
Because they already have an account created with JIT provisioning, Workato does not prompt the user to create an account again.
Instead, Workato prompts the user to verify their identity using the email address associated with their account.
7
After the user verifies their identity, they can join the HR workspace.
8
The user can switch between the Finance and HR workspaces, as necessary.
