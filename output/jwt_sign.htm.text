Sign
Encode and sign a JSON Web Token (JWT).
The signature of a JWT is used to verify that the message hasn't changed when passed between services.
For tokens signed with a private key, the signature can also verify the sender of the JWT.
Input
Field
Definition
Type
Required
key
The private key used to sign the JWT, so that a second party can then verify that the payload in the token is legitimate.
You can share private keys, but many algorithms can use the corresponding public key for decoding.
Text
FALSE
options
audience
Identifies the intended recipients for the JWT.
This is a case-sensitive text value that contains a string or a URI value.
Use of the 
audience
 claim (
aud
) is optional.
Text
FALSE
issuer
Identifies the issuer of the JWT.
This is a case-sensitive text value that contains a string or a URI value.
Use of the 
issuer
 claim (
iss
) is optional.
Text
FALSE
expiresIn
Identifies the amount of time in seconds after which the JWT shouldn't be accepted for processing.
Use of the 
expiresIn
 claim (
exp
) is optional.
Number
FALSE
jwtid
Provides a unique identifier for the JWT. You can use this identifier to prevent the JWT from being replayed.
This is a case-sensitive text value.
Use of the 
jwtid
 claim (
jti
) is optional.
Text
FALSE
noTimestamp
Indicates whether a time stamp should be added to the signature to indicate the time when the JWT was issued.
This field is optional. 
The default value is 
False
, meaning that time stamps are added.
True/False
FALSE
header
Signed tokens use a header known as the JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) header.
The header includes the algorithm (
alg
) used to process the data contained in the JWT and the type (
typ
) of the token, usually JWT. For example:
Copy
{
    "typ":"JWT",
    "alg":"HS256"
}
This field is Base64-encoded before being added to the token.
Text
FALSE
notBefore
Specifies a time before which the JWT isn't accepted for processing.
This is the inverse of the 
expiresIn
 value.
The value is a number that contains a numeric date value (epoch).
Use of the 
notBefore
 claim (
nbf
) is optional.
Number
FALSE
subject
Identifies the subject of the JWT.
For example, if the token payload is information about an app user, you can use the 
subject
 field to pass a user ID.
The 
subject
 should be locally or globally unique.
This is a case-sensitive text value that contains a string or URI value.
Use of the 
subject
 claim (
sub
) is optional.
Text
FALSE
algorithm
Okta Workflows
 supports the following signature algorithms for JWT:
HS256
HS384
HS512
RS256
RS384
RS512
ES256
ES384
ES512
PS265
PS384
PS512
HS256
 is the default.
Dropdown
FALSE
payload
This field accepts any number of key and value pairs through extensible inputs.
To add a key and value pair to the 
payload
, drag an output field from another card.
When Okta creates the 
token
 output, each of these pairs is added to a JSON object and Base64-encoded.
Object
FALSE
Output
Field
Definition
Type
token
The complete JSON Web Token (JWT), including the Base64-encoded header, and the payload and signature.
