Type
Required
token
The complete JSON Web Token (JWT), including the Base64-encoded header, and the payload and signature.
Text

The private or public key required to verify the signature of the JWT.
You can share private keys, but many algorithms can use the corresponding public key for decoding.
Text
TRUE
options
audience
Identifies the intended recipients for the JWT.
This is a case-sensitive text value that contains a string or a URI value.
Use of the 
audience
 claim (
aud
) is optional.

Extensible outputs allow you to manually add an output field for each key that you expect to return with the payload.
You can then drag these outputs to other inputs in the flow to process the data.
