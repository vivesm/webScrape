List management FAQs
Get answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about list management.
Why are lists important in app integrations with Workato?
Lists
, also known as arrays, are essential in app integrations because they allow you to work with structured data. Many integration tasks involve manipulating lists of items, such as syncing sales invoices with line items or syncing customer accounts with associated leads and contacts.
Is there an example of list setup in Workato?
Yes, in most examples, a CSV file is used as the sample list. You can find an example CSV file with columns like Manufacturer, Model, Category, and more. This CSV file serves as a reference for list management tasks. Refer to the
Example list setup
section for more information.
How can I configure Workato to read and manipulate lists from a CSV file in a Box folder?
To work with a CSV file in a
Box folder
, you can use the Box trigger
New CSV file
to read the file and parse it as a list of CSV lines. Ensure that the column names in the CSV file match the fields you plan to work with.
What are some ways to map datapills from lists into Workato actions?
You can
map datapills
from lists in three ways:
Directly into an action without list processing.
Into an action with a list input where the action handles list processing implicitly.
Into an action with a Repeat step where list processing must be done explicitly at the recipe logic level.
What happens when I use datapills directly from a list in an action without list processing?
When you
use datapills directly from a list without list processing
, only the values of the first list item will be retrieved and used in the action. Subsequent list items won't be processed unless explicitly handled.
Are there actions in Workato that accept lists as input?
Yes, certain actions in Workato, such as Salesforce bulk insert and bulk update actions,
accept lists as input
. This can be useful for tasks like importing multiple records at the same time.
How can I use datapills from lists in actions with list inputs?
Actions that accept lists as input
typically have a field called
Source list
that takes list datapills. You can map list datapills into this field to transfer the list from the source app to the target app based on the mapped fields.
What is the purpose of the Repeat step when working with lists in Workato?
The
Repeat step
is used when an action doesn't handle list processing automatically. It allows you to iterate through a list and carry out the same action multiple times, with different values from the list during each iteration.
What is the List connector (Accumulator) in Workato used for?
The
List connector
, known as the Accumulator, is used to create custom lists and store data within them for the duration of a job. This data can be used within the same job, typically for preparing data to be used in actions with list inputs.
LISTS BY WORKATO DEPRECATION NOTICE
Workato has deprecated the Lists by Workato connector. Although we continue to provide runtime support for active recipes using this connector, creating new recipes with it is no longer possible. Additionally, we will no longer fix bugs or enhance this connector in the future. We recommend that you transition recipes that use this connector to Variables by Workato, which provides enhanced list management capabilities. This tool enables you to define lists with custom schemas, offering dynamic control over list properties and items. For fixed count loops, you can use
Repeat while
loops with the
Index
datapill, enabling you to precisely control loop execution. For guidance and support, refer to our
Variables by Workato
and
Repeat while loop
documentation.
How can I use the List connector (Accumulator) to create a custom list in Workato?
To
create a custom list
with the Accumulator, define the list fields, ensure it is within a Repeat step, and map datapills from the Repeat step's output datatree to avoid duplication.
