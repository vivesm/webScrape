For Each
Process a list by calling a helper flow for each item.
The 
For Each
 function card does not return any output values. Add this card to a flow when you want to take action against each item in a list but do not need any information in return. 
Use a helper flow
To use this function card, you must first build a helper flow that you will use to process each item. See 
Helper flows
. The helper flow is invoked each time an item is changed in a list. You must also define the input values for the flow on the flow's event card. Typically, include one input for the item that is in the list. For example, if the list contains text values, then one of the inputs should be of the type text. You can also include other inputs.
If you need to know the position of the current item within a list, use the 
Index
 field on the 
Helper Flow
 card. 
Update the For Each function card
On the For Each function card,  add the list you want to use in the 
list
 field, and then select the flow you just built. The inputs will populate automatically, then you can map data into them.
To map an input to accept each item of the list, click that field and select 
item
 from the dropdown. If your list is a list of objects where you can see the schema of the object, choose to have your helper flow accept those as inputs. 
Additionally, you can drag outputs from previous cards in the flow, in which case the same value will be used for each item in this list.
