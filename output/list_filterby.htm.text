Filter
Filter a list to include only those items that meet a specified condition. To filter based on more complex criteria, use 
Filter Custom
Input
Field
Definition
Type
Required
list
                                List that is the target of the search performed by the Filter function card.
List of Objects
TRUE
operator
Specific comparison to be performed on a list (see Table of Relational Operators below).
Dropdown
TRUE
path
                                When searching within a list of objects, 
path
 is the name of the key that holds the value you want to compare. Use a period to specify a path to an object inside another object. For example, 
customer.id
.
For a spreadsheet, a full 
path
 value is required to specify a column. For example, for a column with the label 
Status
, the 
path
 value is 
Columns.1-Status
.
Leave this field blank when searching within a list of text, numbers, or date/time.
String
FALSE
comparison
Value that is the target for comparison.
String
TRUE
Be sure to set the 
type
 of the input list and comparison to dictate how the comparison is performed. For example, the operator 
greater than
 compares numbers based on numeric value, but text based on alphabetical sort order. Thus, the number comparison 80 > 9 is true, but the text comparison "80" > "9" is false.

Table of Relational Operators
Operator
Use Case
equal to
Compare two texts, numbers, dates or true/false to see if they have the same value.
not equal 
Compare two texts, numbers, dates or true/false to see if they have different values. To compare objects, use this option instead of 
doesn't have key
.
greater than or equal
Compare two texts, numbers or dates to see if the first has the same or greater value than the second.
less than or equal
Compare two texts, numbers or dates to see if the first has the same or lesser value than the second.
greater than
Compare two texts, numbers or dates to see if the first has a greater value than the second.
less than
Compare two texts, numbers or dates to see if the first has a lesser value than the second.
a multiple of
Compare two numbers to see if value a is an exact multiple of value b. For example, 12, 0 and -4 are all multiples of 4, but 2, 3 and 7 are not.
in
Compare two texts to see if value a is a part of value b. For example, "test" is in "this is a test", but there is no "i" in "team".
not in
Compare two texts to see if value a is not part of value b.
has key
When value a is an object and value b is text, tests to see if the object has a key with the specified name. For example, true if value a is {"test":123} and value b is "test".
doesn't have key
When value a is an object and value b is text, tests to see if the object does not have a key with the specified name.
is empty
Checks to see if value a is empty; ignores value b. Definition of "empty" varies by type. Note: Only works for Text and Object. Numbers, Dates, T/F, are viewed as empty.
is not empty
Checks to see if value a is not empty. Note: Only works for Text and Object. Numbers, Dates, T/F, are viewed as empty.
