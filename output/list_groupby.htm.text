Group By
This function takes a list and outputs an object that's grouped by the values in the original list at the specified path.
The function returns an object that groups a list of items, for example, objects, strings, or numbers, according to the specified path value. Each unique value for the specified path in the input list has a corresponding key in the object. For each key in the returned object, this function returns a list of items from the input list that have a matching value to the key's specified path.

Examples
A simple example takes the following as inputs:
Copy
list = [{"a":1},{"a":2},{"a":3},{"a":3},{"a":3}]
path = a
This function takes the input list, groups it by the specified 
path
 and outputs the following:
Copy
{
    "1": [ {"a": 1} ],
    "2": [ {"a": 2} ],
    "3": 
        [ 
            {"a": 3},
            {"a": 3},
            {"a": 3}
        ]
}
A slightly more involved example takes the following inputs:
Copy
list = 
[
  {
    "a": 1,
    "b": {
      "c": 2,
      "d": 3
    }
  },
  {
    "a": 4,
    "b": {
      "c": 5,
      "d": 6
    }
  },
  {
    "a": 7,
    "b": {
      "c": 8,
      "d": 6
    }
  }
]
path = b.d
For the preceding input, the function returns an object that's grouped around the values at the path 
b.d
:
Copy
{
  "3": [
    {
      "a": 1,
      "b": {
        "c": 2,
        "d": 3
      }
    }
  ],
  "6": [
    {
      "a": 4,
      "b": {
        "c": 5,
        "d": 6
      }
    },
    {
      "a": 7,
      "b": {
        "c": 8,
        "d": 6
      }
    }
  ]
}
