List to Text
This function generates a single text output from a list using an optional separator. For example, if you have a list of product names, this function can create a comma-separated list of products to include in an email.
The function works with the following types:
List of Text
Number
True/False
Date & Time
If you send a List of Objects to this function, it results in an error. First, you need to convert it to a List of Text:
Use the 
Pluck
 function to get a list of the 
values
 from a single 
key
 of the objects.
On the 
Pluck
 card, change the 
values
 output type to 
Text
. This changes the output of the card into a List of Text.
Pass that List of Text into this 
List to Text
 card.
