Pluck
This function takes a list of objects, and produces a sub-list. It does that by plucking the key specified by 
key
 from each object in the input list, and putting those values into an output list. The 
list
 input must be a list of objects. The 
key
 input defines the key to pluck from each item; it can be a key name in the root of each item, or it can be a dot-delimited path that lets you specify keys in sub-objects. You must set the type of the 
values
 output list to be the type of the values at that key path; if you don't set the type correctly, you will very likely encounter type mismatch errors when you execute your flow.
Input Fields
list
 (list of objects): The list to operate on. Must be a list of objects.
key
 (text):  The key to pluck from each input item. Can be a dot-delimited path.
Output Fields
values
:  The output list. You must set the type of items in the list to match the type of the values at the key that 
path
 defines.
Example
If 
list
 is 
[{"name":"Bob","gender":"male"}, {"name":"Sarah","gender":"female"}]
 and 
key
 is 
name
, then 
values
 (which should be set to list of text) is: 
["Bob","Sarah"]
.
