Sort
Sort a list from smallest to largest.
Input Fields
list
 - The list you want to sort.
path
 - If 
list
 is a list of objects, 
path
 is the name of the key to sort the objects by or a path if the object contains other objects (for example, "customer.lastname"); otherwise, you can leave 
path
 blank.
Output Fields
sorted list
 - The list sorted from smallest to largest.
NOTE: Numbers will sort differently if you are using a list of text versus a list of numbers (or if the chosen key of the object is text versus a number). In numeric sort order 9 comes before 80, but in alphabetical sort order "80" comes before "9". If you need to convert from string to number, use 
Sort Custom
 instead where you call a helper flow to specify the value to use for each item.
To sort by more than one key, use multiple Sort cards in a row, ending with the Sort using the primary key. To sort from largest to smallest, use 
Reverse
 after Sort. To do more complicated sorts, use the 
Sort Custom
 function which calls a helper flow to determine the value to sort each item by.
Examples
If 
list
 is 
[9,80,20,1]
 then 
sorted list
 is 
[1,9,20,80]
 - number order for numbers
If 
list
 is 
["9","80","20","1"]
 then 
sorted list
 is 
["1","20","80","9"]
 - alphabetic order for lists of text
If 
list
 is 
[{"name":"Nicole","value":10}, {"name":"Sarah","value":20}, {"name":"Emily","value":30}]
 and 
path
 is "name" then 
sorted list
 is: 
[{"name":"Emily","value":30}, {"name":"Nicole","value":10}, {"name":"Sarah","value":20}]
 - objects alphabetically sorted using name.
