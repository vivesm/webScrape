Remove Duplicates
Removes duplicates from a list.
Input
Field
Definition
Type
Required
List
A list of objects that contains the duplicates you want to remove.
List of Objects
TRUE
Path
While 
List
 is a list of objects, 
Path
 is the name of the key that determines whether something is a duplicate or not.
For example, you may want just one customer record per unique email address.
Text
TRUE
Output
Field
Definition
Type
List No Duplicates
A list of objects with the duplicate items removed.
List of Objects
To filter out duplicates using more complex criteria than a single value or key, use the 
Unique Custom
 function. This function calls a helper flow to determine the value for each item and determines if it's unique or not.
Examples
If the 
List
 is 
9,80,1,9,20,1
 then the returned 
List No Duplicates
 is 
9, 80, 1, 20
. The function returns only one instance of each number. The card doesn't consider the 
Path
 value in this example, as there's only one item in each object.
As another example, consider the following elements in a list of defined objects:
Copy
[
  {
    "name": "Nicole",
    "value": 10
  },
  {
    "name": "Sarah",
    "value": 20
  },
  {
    "name": "Emily",
    "value": 10
  }
]
 If the input for the 
Path
 is 
value
, then the returned 
List No Duplicates
 has only one object with the value of 
10
:
Copy
[
  {
    "name": "Nicole",
    "value": 10
  },
  {
    "name": "Sarah",
    "value": 20
  }
]
 If the input for the 
Path
 is 
name
, then the returned 
List No Duplicates
 is unchanged:
Copy
[
  {
    "name": "Nicole",
    "value": 10
  },
  {
    "name": "Sarah",
    "value": 20
  },
  {
    "name": "Emily",
    "value": 10
  }
]
