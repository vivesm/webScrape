XOR
XOR stands for "exclusive or". Take two input lists and generate a new list that contains all of the items that are in one or the other input list but not both.
The lists can be of any type (text, number, object, and so forth) as long as both input lists and the output list are set to the same type.
Input Fields
list1
:  The first list of items.
list2
:  The second list of items.
Output Fields
list
:  The output list, containing just those items that are in list1 or list2 but not both.
