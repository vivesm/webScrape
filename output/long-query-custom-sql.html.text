#
Run long query custom SQL action
This action enables you to run custom SQL queries asynchronously within a timeout limit you configure. You can use this action to execute Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements like
INSERT
,
UPDATE
, and
DELETE
, as well as Data Definition Language (DDL) commands, like
CREATE
,
ALTER
, and
DROP
.
After the custom SQL query begins processing, the action periodically checks if the results are ready for retrieval. The recipe moves to the next step after it retrieves the results successfully.
