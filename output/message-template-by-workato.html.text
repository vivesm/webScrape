Message template by Workato
The Message template by Workato connector enables you to create and use static
Message templates
for commonly used messages in your recipes. These templates use
Mustache
(opens new window)
as the templating language. Message templates can be used to generate HTML, text, JSON, and XML messages. They also allow you to separate the message composition logic (what the message looks like) from the message generation logic (when the message is sent). This separation enables you to change the message format without changing the recipe that sends the message.
MESSAGE TEMPLATE ESCAPES HARMFUL ELEMENTS
Message template escapes some potentially harmful HTML elements, such as those that could lead to XML injection.
#
Create a new template
Templates define a structure for variables and body text that is consistent across runs and recipes.
Complete the following steps to create a new template:
1
Navigate to
Tools > Message templates
and click
+ New template
.
2
Provide the body text of the message in the
Template body
field. Specify variables by wrapping them in double brackets (
{{}}
).
This field uses Mustache as its templating language. Refer to the
Mustache documentation
(opens new window)
or the variables section of the
Message template
page for more information.
3
Add your variables in the
Template input
. You can use JSON or manually create your variables. Template variables support both scalar data types (string, integer, date, number, time, and boolean) and complex data types (object and list). You can define values for template variables using the
Create message
action.
