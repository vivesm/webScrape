Migrate your connection to Stripe Apps
This guide explains how to migrate your Stripe connection from the Stripe extension to
Stripe Apps
(opens new window)
. Stripe extensions will no longer be supported after
January 1, 2025
.
STRIPE APPS
If you created your Stripe connection
on or after December 10, 2024
, it is already configured to use Stripe Apps. No additional action is required.
Similarly, no action is needed if your Stripe connection uses
API key authentication
.
#
Review active Stripe connections
Refer to the email you received for a list of your active Stripe connections. Alternatively, you can locate your active Stripe connections in Workato by completing the following steps:
1
Sign in to your Workato account.
2
Go to
Assets > Connections
.
Click the Connections tab
3
Click the
All apps
filter, then search for
Stripe
and select it.
Filter for Stripe connections
4
Click the
All statuses
filter and select
Connected
to view active Stripe connections in your workspace.

#
Review dependent recipes
Evaluate the number of recipes that use your active Stripe connections by completing the following steps:
1
Click the Stripe connection.
2
Confirm that the
Authentication type
is set to
Authorization code grant
.
API KEY AUTHENTICATION
If the connection uses API key authentication, this guide does not apply, and no action is needed.
3
Locate the
Dependencies
section to view the number of recipes using your Stripe connection.
4
Click the link to open the
Dependency graph
for more details about the dependent recipes.
Click the link to view dependencies
5
Assess the number and status of dependent recipes to determine the scope of your migration.
Repeat these steps for all Stripe connections created or connected before December 10, 2024.
#
Prepare your recipes for testing
Before you
test your recipes
, ensure you're working with a version that uses the extension-based Stripe connection. Testing a version that mirrors your current setup helps you identify migration-related issues early.
For workspaces with Environments enabled
: Open the version of your active recipe in the test environment.
For workspaces without Environments
: Clone your active recipe to create a separate version for testing.

Open the recipe you’re testing and click the
Connections
tab.
2
Select the current Stripe connection.
Select the existing Stripe connection

1
Open the recipe in the recipe editor.
2
Click
Test recipe
to initiate the test run.
3
Monitor the recipe's execution to verify that it processes data correctly at each step. Ensure all inputs and outputs align with your expectations.
Repeat these steps for each recipe that requires an updated Stripe connection.
#
Replace the connection in production recipes
After confirming that your recipes function correctly with the demo Stripe connection, replace the connections in your active production recipes.
1
Create a new Stripe connection
using the
Authorization code grant
authentication method. Select
No
from the
Demo
drop-down menu to specify that the connection is for a live account.
2
Open a recipe that uses an extension-based Stripe connection and click the
Connections
tab.
3
Choose the Stripe connection.
Select the existing Stripe connection
4
Click
Switch
.
Click Switch
5
Select the new Stripe connection you created.
LIMITATIONS
Stripe allows only one connection per Stripe account and Stripe App pair. When you create a new App-based Stripe connection for the
same Stripe account
, it invalidates the tokens of any previously connected App-based Stripe connections for that account, making them inactive. However, if the connection is linked to a
different Stripe account
, existing connections remain unaffected.
This limitation does not impact pre-existing extension-based Stripe connections in Workato, which can coexist with App-based connections.
