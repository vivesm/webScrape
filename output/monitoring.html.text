On-prem agent

On-prem Agent monitoring
Starting with on-prem agent version
2.14.0
, you can monitor agents by gathering data and system metrics. This helps you resolve issues due to unstable connections and other technical issues. If the on-prem Agent becomes unstable, on-prem Agent Monitoring helps you find the root cause and re-establish robust and reliable connections. Run the agent with the monitoring option on, and gather additional information regarding agent performance.
You can view the report online, save it to view offline, or export it as a PDF. You can also run a heap dump.
After you complete your monitoring tasks, disable the monitoring option and restart the agent.
