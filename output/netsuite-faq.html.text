action to create invoices from the
lines
datapill.

Missing fields from Search custom record type
The custom action
created
and
lastModified

Custom record type: Show created date and lastModified

Error
invalid subsidiary reference netsuite
In NetSuite, a subsidiary object may itself contain child subsidiaries. The permission sets for each subsidiary is unique and distinct. If the Workato connection does not have the necessary permissions, it will cause an
invalid subsidiary reference
error.
Using any CREATE, UPDATE, or UPSERT actions with a record that has a subsidiary inaccessible to the integration role results in an invalid subsidiary reference error. This causes the action to fail.
When using the SEARCH action, the action will not be able to retrieve any records. Although the action will be fail and your will not have any indicative errors, this is not the desired behavior.
To resolve this, ensure that the credentials provided have the necessary permissions to work with the subsidiary objects.
#
Error
The restrictions on your role deny you access to this record
If the NetSuite credentials do not have the appropriate permissions, the recipe cannot access cross-subsidiary records. To resolve this, update the permissions for the connection credentials and set
Allow Cross-Subsidiary Record Viewing
to True.
Go to Setup> Users/Roles > Manage Roles
Customize or Edit the Role
Make sure that the Allow Cross-Subsidiary Record Viewing is checked
Click Save
