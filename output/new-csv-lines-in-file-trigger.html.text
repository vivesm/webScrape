FileStorage trigger - New lines in CSV file (batch)
FILE AND DIRECTORY ACCESS
Currently, all users in a workspace can access all FileStorage files and directories in the workspace when they use the
FileStorage connector
. Workato does not restrict access based on role unless the files are accessed from the
FileStorage UI
.
This trigger is initiated immediately, in real time, when new lines are added to an existing CSV file in
Workato FileStorage
. The trigger returns rows and columns from the CSV file in
batches
.
All existing lines in the file will be processed when the recipe starts. Updating the data in the file externally without using the connector actions may cause the trigger to stop tracking the new lines correctly.

Input fields
Field
Description
File to monitor
Choose a CSV file to monitor from the drop-down menu or enter the file path directly (for example,
samplepath/filename.csv
).
If you choose a file from the drop-down menu, only CSV files stored with column schema are displayed. Note that for a CSV file to be identified and picked up by this trigger, it must be stored using the
Create file
action with the
Create CSV file
option set to
Yes
, or the
Append to file
action with
Append CSV content
set to
Yes
.
Batch size
Number of CSV rows to retrieve per job. Instead of reading records one by one, Workato reads a batch of CSV records at the same time to increase throughput. Refer to
Batch processing
for more information. Defaults to
1000
if not specified. Maximum is
50000
. If the records are very large, the trigger automatically reduces the number of records retrieved to optimize processing.
Columns to retrieve
Select the CSV columns that you plan to use in your recipe. If this field is left blank, Workato retrieves all columns. Otherwise, Workato retrieves only the columns you select.
