HubSpot - New/Updated record triggers
This section contains documentation on the triggers that are currently supported on the Workato platform, including:
New/Updated Record Trigger
New/Updated Record batch Trigger
DEPRECATION NOTICE
The triggers below have been deprecated. Please use the New/Updated Record trigger instead.
New/Updated Company Trigger
New/Updated Contact Trigger
New/Updated Deal Trigger
#
Trigger conditions
For each trigger, you can configure trigger conditions. Trigger conditions are like filters in Workato. Turning on trigger conditions in Workato means that you can selectively choose which events you want to trigger workflows. Conditions can be set on object attributes like approval status. This allows you to build workflows that are only triggered on things such as approved purchase orders or invoices.
#
New/Updated record trigger
Triggers when a new record is created or an existing record is updated in your HubSpot instance. Each record will be processed as a separate job. It checks for new jobs once every poll interval. To configure this action, you will need to first select the object you want to trigger jobs off.
We currently support the following objects:
Contact
Company
Deal
Product
Ticket
Line Item
Quote

It processes these records in batches as opposed to a single record per job. To configure this trigger, you will need to first select the object you want to trigger jobs off.
We currently support the following objects:
