Formula
Build a math expression by combining operators, functions and numbers that you enter with fields that you drag and drop into the Formula card. You can place fields of the type 
Number
 anywhere in the expression where there can be a number. At runtime, the expression is evaluated using the values of the fields to generate a single; 
output
 number.
You can use the following operators:
+
 for addition
-
 for subtraction (or negative)
*
 for multiply
/
 for divide
^
 for power; for example, 
10^2
 returns 100
%
 for remainder; for example, 
12%5
 returns 2
!
 for factorial; for example, 
3!
 returns 6
#
 allows you to add a comment to your expression (anything you type after the # is ignored when the expression is evaluated)
Use 
parentheses
 to group operations so they calculate together first.
You can also use standard math functions (with arguments inside parentheses), including:
abs
 - absolute value; for example, 
abs(-10)
 returns 10
ceil
 - rounds up to the nearest integer
floor
 - rounds down to the nearest integer
min
 - the smallest of a comma separated list of numbers
max -
 the largest of a comma separated list of numbers
round
 - rounds to the nearest integer
random
 - a random number between 0 and a given value, or 1 if followed by empty parentheses; for example, 
random(10)
 or 
random()
exp
 - 
e
 to the power of a given value
log
 - the logarithm using base e of a value
log10
 - the logarithm using base 10 of a value
pow
 - the first parameter to the power of the second parameter; for example, 
pow(2,3)
 returns 8
sqrt
 - the square root of a value
pi
 - the value for pi (use without parentheses)
sin
 - the sine of an provided angle in radians
cos
 - the cosine of an provided angle in radians
tan
 - the tangent of an provided angle in radians
asin
 - the arcsine of a value between -1 and 1
acos
 - the arccosine of a value between -1 and 1
atan
 - the arctangent of a value between -1 and 1
sinh
 - the hyperbolic sine of a value between -1 and 1
cosh
 - the hyperbolic cosine of a value between -1 and 1
tanh
 - the hyperbolic tangent of a value between -1 and 1
You can combine multiple operations, such as:
(pi*(max(10,11,12)^2))+round(random(5))
And number fields (such as dropping an output from a previous card into the middle of a calculation) can be used in place of any number value.
For 
binary arithmetic
, use 
&
 (bitwise and), 
~
 (bitwise not), 
|
 (bitwise or), 
^|
 (bitwise xor), 
<<
 (left shift), and 
>>
 (right shift).
Input
The function has one large input area that accepts a combination of numbers, operators, and math functions you type with number fields you drag/drop in.
Output
The calculation that results from evaluating the expression using the values of the fields at runtime.
