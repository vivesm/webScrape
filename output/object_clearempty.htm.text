Clear Empty
The Clear Empty function card removes keys with no values associated (for example, null, "", {}) from an object. Similar to the Object - Filter function but with the added ability of choosing whether or not the filtering is recursive.
Input Fields
object
:  the object you want to operate on
recursive
: indicates how to handle objects that have sub-objects (see example below)
when false
: the object is cleared of any keys that have empty values at the top level only
when true
: the object is cleared of any empty keys, at any level
Output Fields
output
: your input object without the empty keys
Examples
If the input 
object
 is 
{"Name":"Emily", "Age":"", "Settings": {"test":{ }, "test2":"value2"}}
If 
recursive
 is false, then 
output
 is 
{"Name":"Emily", "Settings":{"test":{ },"test2":"value2"}}
If 
recursive
 is true, then 
output
 is 
{"Name":"Emily", "Settings":{"test2":"value2"}}
