For Each
The 
For Each
 function iterates through each key in an object using a helper flow. 
For each key in the input object, the helper flow is called with the 
key
 name and the 
value
 for that key. The helper flow processes each key and value pair, along with any constants passed into the helper flow. 
You can select these using the dropdown list in the 
With the following values
 field after selecting a helper flow from the 
Select Flow
 dialog.
The 
For Each
 function card doesn't create any output. It simply performs the actions in the helper flow.
