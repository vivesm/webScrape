Filter
The Filter card removes keys that have no associated value (for example, 
null
, 
""
, 
{}
) from an object. 
If the object might contain other objects, use the 
Clear Empty
 card instead.
Input Fields
object
:  the object you want to operate on
Output Fields
output
: your input object without empty keys
Examples
Input object
Copy
Input object
{
  "Name": "Emily",
  "Age": "",
  "Settings": {
    "test": {},
    "test2": "value2"
  }
}
Output object
Copy
Output object
{
  "Name": "Emily",
  "Settings": {
    "test": {},
    "test2": "value2"
  }
}
Note that the 
test
 key remains because it is a sub-object. If you want to remove empty keys from sub-objects, use the 
Clear Empty
 function instead.
