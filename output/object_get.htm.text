Get
Reads the value at a given path inside in an object. 
For example, if the object is 
{ "a":"one", "b":"two", "c": 17 }
, then specifying a path of 
b
 retrieves the value 
two
.
To get more than one value at a time from an object, use 
Get Multiple
 instead.
The output type should match the actual type of the value at that path. If the types don't match, the flow  can fail at runtime.
For example, if you specify a path of 
c
 inside the object 
{ "a":"one", "b":"two", "c": 17 }
, the 
output
 type should be number because 
17
 is a number, not text.
Nested objects
You can retrieve values from nested objects by using a 
.
 (period) character to separate the key names. For example, if the object is 
{ "all": { "b": "banana", "c":"cucumber" } }
 then a path of 
all.c
 indicates that the function should look for the key named 
c
 that is inside the key named 
all
. The function would return the value 
cucumber
.
Objects with lists
In addition, if the path contains a list, you can use the index number for the list item when you specify the path:
Copy
{
  "all": [
    {
      "b": "banana"
    },
    {
      "b": "blackberry"
    },
    {
      "b": "breadfruit"
    }
  ]
}
 If you specify a path of 
all.2.b
, then the function looks inside the object for the key 
all
. It then retrieves the item at the index value of 
2
 (since indexes start at 
0
, this is the third value in the list) with a key named 
b
. The function would return the value 
breadfruit
 from this example.
