Map
The 
Map
 function iterates through each key in an object using a helper flow and creates an object as output.  
For each key in the input object, the helper flow executes with the 
key
 name and the corresponding 
value
. After selecting a helper flow from the 
Select Flow
 dialog, you can pass the key and value fields using the dropdown choices in the 
With the following values
 section.
The helper flow must output two values, 
key
 and 
value
, using a 
Return
 card. Each key and value pair creates one key in the new output object. 
The helper flow can also filter out some keys using 
Continue If
 or similar branching logic. For example, if the helper flow completes without returning a key and value pair, then that iteration doesn't provide a key to the output object.
