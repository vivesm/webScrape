On-prem Files
This connector lets you integrate with files within a secure network. These files typically are behind a corporate firewall and cannot be accessed directly. To create a connection to on-prem files, you
must
use an
On-prem agent
.
Workato's
On-prem files
connector allows you to securely connect to those on-premises files and build automation around them.
#
How to connect to on-prem files on Workato
Before creating a connection for this connector, make sure you go through an
on-prem agent setup
and create a profile for
on-prem files
.
When setting up connection directly in workato using cloud profile
You don't have to edit on-prem config file, set up all properties directly in workato as shown below.
WARNING
Ensure proper access control for the agent process to allow access only to specific files and folders.
Additionally, you can restrict access to this on-prem connection using dedicated
privileges
(opens new window)
.
On-prem files connection using on-prem agent
Field
Description
Connection name
Give this On-prem files connection a unique name that identifies which On-prem files instance it is connected to.
Is this app in a private network?
Select the on-prem group that you setup earlier.
On-prem connection profile
Name of the profile you wish to connect to. This should be defined in your
config.yml
file in your On-prem agent.
Base
If you have selected on-prem group that supports setting up connection details directly in workato you will specify base path here.

Working with the On-prem files connector
#
Relative path
Relative path is a way to specify the location of a file or folder based on the location of another folder. This is different from absolute path where you specify the full location of a file.
When setting up connection directly in workato using cloud profile
You don't have to edit on-prem config file, set up base path directly in workato. Please skip below configuration.
File or folder path in the on-prem files connector are all relative paths. It is relative to the base path you define in the connection
profile
of your
config.yml
file. Let's take a look at an example.
Here, we have a profile with the base path defined as the
/Users/admin/projects
folder using the
base
property.
files
:
projects
:
base
:
/Users/admin/projects
Now, if you wish to point to a file in this sub-folder
/Users/admin/projects/engineering/2018_roadmap.csv
, you will have to use the relative path
/engineering/2018_roadmap.csv
. When used in a download file action, it will look like this.
Download content from file path
Similarly, to point to a sub-folder
/Users/admin/projects/marketing/users
, use the relative path
/marketing/users
.
Move file to a folder using folder path
#
Naming pattern
Frequently, you may have a log of multiple files with a naming convention. These names typically either includes an incremental count to represent the versions or timestamp to represent the effective date of the contents. Defining a naming pattern allows you to filter files based on these naming conventions. Workato uses the
?
and
*
symbols to represent any single character or multiple characters respectively.
#
Single character wildcard
?
The
?
symbol is used to represent any character once. For example,
Report_draft_?.pdf
can be used to represent
Report_draft_1.pdf
,
Report_draft_2.pdf
and
Report_draft_3.pdf
.
#
Multiple character wildcard
*
The
*
symbol is used to represent any zero or more characters. For example,
Report_draft*.pdf
can be used to represent
Report_draft.pdf
,
Report_draft_1.pdf
,
Report_draft_2.pdf
and
Report_draft_3.pdf
.
#
Using naming pattern in a recipe
Let's look at an example of a marketing manager who needs to work with a folder that contains a few type of information series of webinar.
📂 Marketing
📂 ProductHour
📄 Attendees_2018_11_29.csv
📄 Attendees_2018_11_15.csv
📄 Attendees_2018_11_01.csv
📋 Poll_responses_2018_11_29.txt
📋 Poll_responses_2018_11_15.txt
📋 Poll_responses_2018_11_01.txt
📊 Slides_2018_11_29.pptx
📊 Slides_2018_11_15.pptx
📊 Slides_2018_11_01.pptx
Based on each use case, files from this folder can be filtered in a number of ways.
