    Okta Verify (Push/OTP) integration guide
The expected behavior of Okta Verify is to reflect the context of the original client request when a user receives a push notification. This behavior isn't honored in proxy model architectures. In proxy model architectures, a server-side application using the embedded SDK is used as a proxy between client applications and Okta servers.
The Okta Verify push notification always displays the server's IP address and user agent regardless of any passed-in request context. As a result, Okta Verify is unavailable for server-side applications using the embedded SDK until Okta finds a solution.
