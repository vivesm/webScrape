    Change your primary email address
    Identity Engine
Allowing a user to change their primary email is a critical task when they only use their username and email address to sign in to your app. A user must be able to change their email address, especially if it becomes compromised.
Use 
Okta .NET management SDK
(opens new window)
 to update the user's profile information with a new primary email address. Set the user's 
Profile.Email
 property to the new email address and then call 
user.UpdateAsync()
 to update it on the Okta servers.

: The 
Okta .NET management SDK
(opens new window)
 uses the 
Users API
(opens new window)
 to update the user's profile information.
