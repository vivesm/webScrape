About custom authentication and the Devices SDK 
The Devices SDK allows you to embed push notifications and biometrics directly into your mobile app. As a result, you can control the entire authentication experience by keeping users on your mobile app for the entire sign-in process.
The Devices SDK implements the Custom Authenticator. The Custom Authenticator is another authenticator besides Okta Verify you can use for push notifications. In addition, by implementing a custom authentication flow in your app, you also help drive downloads of your app.
Get started 
This guide walks you through the two main tasks needed to integrate with the Okta Devices SDK:
Create a Custom Authenticator
Create an OIDC web authentication client
: Set up OAuth for your app.
Grant the required scopes
: Grant the scopes that you need to create a Custom Authenticator.
Set up notification services
: Set up 
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
 with your Okta org.
Add a Custom Authenticator
: Create and brand a Custom Authenticator.
Set up a global session policy and authentication policy
: Control who can access Okta and how.
Install and configure the Okta Devices SDK
Install the dependency
: Add the Okta Devices SDK dependency to your 
build.gradle
 file.
Initialize the client
: Create the SDK object to work with your Okta authenticator configuration.
Enroll the device
: Register a device and optional biometrics with an account for use with the custom authenticator.
Respond to a challenge
: Resolve a delivered challenge from the custom authenticator or retrieve an undelivered challenge. Refresh the FCM device registration token, remediate changed biometrics, and deregister the account on the device.
The following image shows what the Devices SDK enables for end users:
Create a Custom Authenticator 
The following image shows the Devices SDK setup in the Admin Console:
Create an OIDC web authentication client 
The simplest way to integrate authentication in your app is to use the 
Authorization code flow grant type
 and implement the OIDC protocol through a web browser.  You need an access token to start the enrollment flow for the Devices SDK. For future sign-in attempts, consider using refresh tokens. 
See the 
Android Devices SDK sample app
(opens new window)
.
Note:
 For certain background interactions between the app and Okta's server, the 
JWT Bearer grant type
(opens new window)
 is used. For more information, see 
Access Token Management
.
Grant the required scopes 
When you're ready to grant the required scopes, follow these steps:
Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.
Select 
Applications
 > 
Applications
 to see a list of your app integrations.
Open your OpenID Connect client app.
On the 
Okta API Scopes
 tab, click 
Grant
 for the following scopes:
For access to both GET and POST/DELETE endpoints:
okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.manage
For access to GET endpoints only:
okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.read
Alternatively, you can grant scopes using the 
Grant consent to scope for app
(opens new window)
 operation of the Apps API.
Set up notification services 
In the Admin Console, go to 
Security
 > 
Device integrations
.
Click 
Notification Services
.
Click 
Add Notification Service
, then select 
FCM
.
Enter the required information:
Name:
 Enter a unique name for the FCM service.
Service account JSON:
 Enter your service account key in JSON format.
You can use the Google Cloud Console, Google Cloud CLI, or one of the client libraries to create your service account key. See 
Creating and managing service account keys
(opens new window)
.
Click 
Add
.
After you’ve added a notification service, you can check for successful and failed push notifications sent to users in the System Log. See 
View push notification events
(opens new window)
.
Alternatively, you can add a notification service using the 
Push Providers API
(opens new window)
.
Add a Custom Authenticator 
In the Admin Console, go to 
Security
 > 
Authenticators
.
On the 
Setup
 tab, click 
Add Authenticator
.
Click 
Add
 on the 
Custom Authenticator
 tile.
Configure the following settings:
Authenticator name:
 Name for the authenticator. This name is displayed to end users when they sign in.
Add to existing application:
 Select the app that receives the push MFA prompt.
User Verification:
 Choose whether the user must provide a PIN or biometric verification during authentication.
Preferred:
 User verification is optional.
Required:
 User verification is required during setup.
Authenticator logo:
 Select the logo for the authenticator. The end user sees this logo on the authentication pages.
Browse files:
 Upload your logo. It must be an SVG file less than 1 MB. For better quality, use a square logo with a transparent background.
Use default logo:
 Use the default logo.
Configure the connection to the push notification service:
FCM configuration:
 Select the connection to the FCM service that you want the custom authenticator to use.
Select the checkbox to agree to the Okta terms and conditions mentioned in the Admin Console.
Note:
 By adding this feature, you agree to provide any required notices and disclosures to end users. This is your sole responsibility on behalf of the entity that you represent. Include any necessary information from 
https://www.okta.com/privacy-policy
(opens new window)
.
Click 
Add
. The authenticator appears in the list on the 
Setup
 tab.
Alternatively, you can create an authenticator using the 
Authenticator API
(opens new window)
.
Set up a global session policy and authentication policy 
Set up a global session policy and an authentication policy to integrate with the Devices SDK. See 
configure a global session policy and authentication policy
.
Install and configure the Okta Devices SDK 
Use the Devices SDK to add custom push verification functionality to your Android app.
Note:
 The following sample code assumes that suspend functions are called from a coroutine. See 
Kotlin coroutines
(opens new window)
.
The following image shows how data flows through the Devices SDK:
Install the dependency 
Add the Okta Devices SDK dependency to your 
build.gradle
 file:
implementation
(
"com.okta.devices:devices-push:
$
okta
.sdk.version"
)
The latest release version is 
$okta.sdk.version
. See 
Release status
(opens new window)
 for the latest Okta Devices SDK version.
Initialize the client 
Create the SDK object to work with your Okta authenticator configuration. Use the 
PushAuthenticatorBuilder
 to create an authenticator with your application configuration:
If the end user doesn't provide a passphrase, the Devices SDK data isn't encrypted. Secure the passphrase:
val
 authenticator
:
 PushAuthenticator 
=
 PushAuthenticatorBuilder
.
create
(
ApplicationConfig
(
context
,
 appName 
=
"MyApp"
,
 appVersion 
=
 BuildConfig
.
VERSION_NAME
)
)
{
    passphrase 
=
"SecretPassphrase"
.
toByteArray
(
)
// Secret must be stored securely
}
.
getOrThrow
(
)
Enroll the device 
Before enrolling the device, ensure that you have the following:
An OIDC Web Authentication client. See 
Create an OAuth 2.0 app integration
.
A custom authenticator. See 
Add a custom authenticator
.
A registration token from Firebase. See 
Set up notification services
.
To start enrolling the user:
val
 authConfig 
=
DeviceAuthenticatorConfig
(
URL
(
orgUrl
)
,
"oidcClientId"
)
val
 result 
=
 authenticator
.
enroll
(
AuthToken
.
Bearer
(
"accessToken"
)
,
 authConfig
,
 EnrollmentParameters
.
Push
(
FcmToken
(
"registrationToken"
)
,
 enableUserVerification 
=
false
)
)
if
(
result
.
isSuccess
)
{
val
 pushEnrollment
:
 PushEnrollment 
=
 result
.
getOrThrow
(
)
}
Alternatively, you can enroll the device by using the 
MyAccount App Authenticators API
(opens new window)
.
Retrieve enrollments 
To retrieve information about existing enrollments, use 
allEnrollments()
. You can use this to display attributes for a list of accounts or find a specific account to update or delete it. Retrieve all previously enrolled 
PushEnrollment
:
val
 enrollments
:
 List
<
PushEnrollment
>
=
 authenticator
.
allEnrollments
(
)
.
getOrThrow
(
)
Update the registration token 
Whenever the FCM SDK sends your application a new token with 
FirebaseMessagingService.onNewToken
, you can update existing enrollments with the new token by doing the following:
val
 enrollments
:
 List
<
PushEnrollment
>
=
 authenticator
.
allEnrollments
(
)
.
getOrThrow
(
)
// Find the enrollment associated with the current user
enrollments
.
find
{
 it
.
user
(
)
.
name 
==
"myUser"
}
?
.
let
{
 pushEnrollment 
->
    pushEnrollment
.
updateRegistrationToken
(
AuthToken
.
Bearer
(
"accessToken"
)
,
FcmToken
(
"newToken"
)
)
.
onSuccess
{
println
(
"success"
)
}
.
onFailure
{
println
(
"failure"
)
}
}
Alternatively, you can update the registration token by using the 
MyAccount App Authenticators API
(opens new window)
.
Update user verification 
User verification checks that a user is the one claimed. You can do this by asking the user for biometrics. You can enable or disable user verification by doing the following:
val
 enrollments
:
 List
<
PushEnrollment
>
=
 authenticator
.
allEnrollments
(
)
.
getOrThrow
(
)
// Find the enrollment associated with the current user
enrollments
.
find
{
 it
.
user
(
)
.
name 
==
"myUser"
}
?
.
let
{
 pushEnrollment 
->
    pushEnrollment
.
setUserVerification
(
AuthToken
.
Bearer
(
"accessToken"
)
,
true
)
.
onSuccess
{
println
(
"success"
)
}
.
onFailure
{
println
(
"failure"
)
}
}
Alternatively, you can update user verification by using the 
MyAccount App Authenticators API
(opens new window)
.
Delete enrollment 
Use the delete function to delete an enrollment from both the server and the device:
val
 enrollments
:
 List
<
PushEnrollment
>
=
 authenticator
.
allEnrollments
(
)
.
getOrThrow
(
)
// Find the enrollment associated with the current user and delete it
enrollments
.
find
{
 it
.
user
(
)
.
name 
==
"myUser"
}
?
.
let
{
 pushEnrollment 
->
    authenticator
.
delete
(
AuthToken
.
Bearer
(
"accessToken"
)
,
 pushEnrollment
)
.
onSuccess
{
println
(
"success"
)
}
.
onFailure
{
println
(
"failure"
)
}
}
Alternatively, you can delete an enrollment by using the 
MyAccount App Authenticators API
(opens new window)
.
Delete enrollment from the device 
The 
deleteFromDevice
 function doesn't call the server, so it doesn't require authorization. As a result, the function only deletes the enrollment from the device.
Note:
 Use 
deleteFromDevice
 with caution as the user can't meet factor requirements for sign-in attempts after deletion. The server is unaware the authenticator no longer exists.
val
 enrollments
:
 List
<
PushEnrollment
>
=
 authenticator
.
allEnrollments
(
)
.
getOrThrow
(
)
// Find the enrollment associated with the current user
enrollments
.
find
{
 it
.
user
(
)
.
name 
==
"myUser"
}
?
.
let
{
 pushEnrollment 
->
    pushEnrollment
.
deleteFromDevice
(
)
.
onSuccess
{
println
(
"success"
)
}
.
onFailure
{
println
(
"failure"
)
}
}
Respond to a challenge 
When a user attempts to sign in to the enrolled account through an app or a web browser, Okta creates a push challenge. Your push provider sends the push challenge to enrolled devices.
Resolve delivered challenges 
After you receive a challenge, your app should resolve them to proceed with the sign-in flow. The SDK may request remediation steps to resolve the challenge:
UserConsent
: Asks the user to approve or deny the challenge.
UserVerification
: Notifies the app that it requires a biometric verification to proceed.
See the 
Devices SDK sample app
(opens new window)
 for complete details about resolving a push challenge.
val
 fcmRemoteMessage 
=
"PushChallengeString"
// fcm challenge
authenticator
.
parseChallenge
(
fcmRemoteMessage
)
.
onSuccess
{
 challenge 
->
        challenge
.
resolve
(
)
.
onSuccess
{
 remediation 
->
remediate
(
remediation
)
// call method to handle remediation
}
.
onFailure
{
println
(

)
}
}
.
onFailure
{
println
(
"failure"
)
}

fun
remediate
(
remediation

println
(
"Successfully handled. sign in success"
)
is

)
is

->
println
(
"Show a biometric prompt"
)
is
 UserVerificationError 
->
println
(
"Biometric failure"
)
}
}
.
getOrElse
{
// handle error
}
Alternatively, you can respond to a challenge by using the 
MyAccount App Authenticators API
(opens new window)
.
Retrieve undelivered challenges 
Sometimes FCM fails to deliver a notification to the user. Add code to check for pending challenges:
val
 enrollments
:
 List
<
PushEnrollment
>
=
 authenticator
.
allEnrollments
(
)
.
getOrThrow
(
)
// Find the enrollment associated with the current user
enrollments
.
find
{
 it
.
user
(
)
.
name 
==
"myUser"
}
?
.
let
{
 pushEnrollment 
->
    pushEnrollment
.
retrievePushChallenges
(
AuthToken
.
Bearer
(
"accessToken"
)
)
.
onSuccess
{
println
(
"success"
)
}
.
onFailure
{
println
(
"failure"
)
}
}
Alternatively, you can retrieve undelivered challenges by using the 
MyAccount App Authenticators API
(opens new window)
.
Access token management 
The SDK communicates with an Okta server using the HTTPS protocol and requires an access token for user authentication and authorization. For authentication flows and access token requests, use the latest version of the 
Okta Kotlin Mobile SDK
(opens new window)
. To enroll a push authenticator, the user needs to have an access token that contains the 
okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.manage
 scope. You can also use this scope for the following operations:
Enroll and unenroll user verification keys
Update device tokens for push authenticator enrollment
Request pending push challenges
Enable and disable CIBA capability for push authenticator enrollment
Delete push authenticator enrollment
Note:
 Applications that use sensitive data shouldn't store or cache access tokens or refresh access tokens that contain the 
okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.manage
 scope. Instead, reauthenticate the user and get a new access token.
The following is a list of operations that are considered high risk and require reauthentication:
Enroll push authenticator
Enable or disable user verification for push authenticator enrollment
Delete push authenticator enrollment
Maintenance token configuration and usage 
Other operations are low risk and may not require interactive authentication. For that reason, the Okta Devices SDK provides the silent user reauthentication method, 
retrieveMaintenanceToken
. This method retrieves a maintenance access token for reauthentication that allows an application to silently perform the following operations:
Request pending push challenges
Enable and disable CIBA capability for the push authenticator enrollment
Update device tokens for push authenticator enrollment
To successfully obtain the maintenance token, you must first configure your Okta OIDC application to support the JWT Bearer grant type:
You can use the Apps API's 
update app
(opens new window)
 operation (
PUT /apps/${appId}
) to modify the 
settings.oauthClient.grant_types
 property array to include the JWT Bearer grant type, 
urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
.
Alternatively, when you use the Admin Console to add or update the OIDC application in a custom authenticator, the application automatically updates with the JWT Bearer grant type. See 
Add a custom authenticator
.
Apps API usage sample 
Explore the 
Configure and Use JWT Bearer Grant
(opens new window)
 Postman Collection for API examples of how to do the following:
Get your OIDC app object properties.
Update your OIDC app to include the 
urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
 grant type.
Obtain a token with your OIDC app client ID.
Fork this collection and add 
url
, 
apiKey
, 
appId
, and 
yourClientId
 environment variables to run the example endpoints. The 
PUT
 method is a full property-replace operation, so you need to specify all required OIDC app properties, including any previous grant types. See 
Create an API token
 to obtain an 
apiKey
 from your org for testing purposes.
Kotlin maintenance token usage example 
suspend
fun
retrievePushChallenges
(
)
{
val
 readScope 
=
listOf
(
"okta.myAccount.appAuthenticator.maintenance.read"
)
val
 enrollments 
=
 pushAuthenticator
.
allEnrollments
(
)
.
getOrThrow
(
)
    enrollments
.
forEach
{
 enrollment 
->
        enrollment
.
retrieveMaintenanceToken
(
readScope
)
.
onSuccess
{
authToken 
->
            enrollment
.
retrievePushChallenges
(
authToken
)
.
onSuccess
{
 challenges 
->
println
(
"Challenges retrieve: 
$
challenges
"
)
}
.
onFailure
{
error 
->
println
(
error
.
localizedMessage
)
}
}
.
onFailure
{
 error 
->
println
(
error
.
localizedMessage
)
}
}
}
Troubleshoot 
If your push notifications aren't delivering:
Follow the steps to 
view push notification events
(opens new window)
.
To narrow your search parameters, enter the following: 
eventType eq "device.push.provider.update" and displayMessage eq "Push Provider Configuration verification failed"
. See 
Event types
.
In the 
Reason
 section, locate the error message from your push provider. Consult the push provider documentation, if necessary.
Verify that your notification services configuration is valid. See 
Edit a notification service
(opens new window)
.
Click 
Save
 to allow push providers to attempt to send notifications again.
If your push notifications aren't delivered, repeat steps 1 through 5.
