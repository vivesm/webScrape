Terraform configuration
 that can access your org.
An Okta admin account with the super admin role.
Overview 
Maintaining your Terraform configuration can become more challenging as the amount of code increases. Follow the best practices in this article to create more concise code that's easier to understand and maintain, reduces the risk of errors, and increases security.
Organize files by resource type and purpose 
To increase the maintainability of your Terraform configuration, instead of using one file, use one Terraform script file for each resource type or related purpose. For example, define device assurance policies in a file called 
Devices.tf
.
These are some benefits of using multiple files for your Terraform configuration:
Industry best practices support maintainability.
 Use Terraform industry standards to ensure your Terraform files are easy for you and others to understand and maintain.
Support separation by personnel role.
 Team members may create and maintain different parts as the configuration becomes more complex. For example, one person may manage group membership while another updates security policies. Separating files by resource type and purpose reduces the risk of accidental changes to unrelated resources.
Reduce error risks.
 A maintainable configuration decreases the risk of errors, which lowers the chance of security breaches or other problems.
Clean version control history.
 Organizing your Terraform files in a version control system (such as GitHub) makes it easier to see the modification history for each resource type.
Modularize files for reuse and maintainability 
Use 
Terraform resource modules
(opens new window)
 to group related resources and facilitate reuse. Design self-contained modules that focus on a single task or area. For example, when multiple Okta orgs use the same corporate branding assets, you can create a shared module that contains those assets. See the 
Terraform article on developing modules
(opens new window)
.
You can write one script that works in multiple places by using input and output variables. For example, a script for adding groups can use a variable for the list of group names. You can also use variables to create shared modules for different Terraform configurations. See the 
Terraform section on input and output variables
(opens new window)
.
The benefits of modularized projects include:
A shared configuration for different use cases.
Code reuse in different contexts as part of a larger deployment architecture.
Consistency across different deployments.
Simple upgrades to modules are applied across all instances.
Use modules for various types of use cases:
Separate non-Okta resources from Okta resources.
 Enforce clean separation of purpose by separating files into different directories, which can improve maintainability.
Strategic reuse.
 Consolidate configurations for different resources that contain only minor differences. Do this by creating a module that defines common resources and identical lines. Use Terraform input and output variables for the parts of the configuration that differ. For more information, see 
the Terraform documentation on modules
(opens new window)
.
Organize files based on departmental needs or security requirements.
 For example, create modules for different divisions with distinct security needs, such as a default configuration module and another for HIPAA compliance.
Consolidate resources that use the same management API calls for efficient code.
 Consolidation avoids unnecessary API calls, reducing the risk of triggering rate limits.
A module can be stored as a separate source code repository in GitHub or the Terraform Registry. Multiple configurations can use the same module without duplicating code. Reference the remote module in Terraform using its remote source URL and set any input variables:
module
 "hipaa" 
{
source
=
"git::https://github.com/myorg/tf-module-hipaa.git?ref=v1.0.0"
# Other parameters…
my_org_name
=
"foo"
number_of_servers
=
5
}
Consider identifying specific versions of your modules using branches or version tags. Explicit versioning reduces the risk of importing unexpected and untested changes from the remote module.
Securely store secrets and credentials 
Store credentials and other secrets securely. This section describes some best practices for handling these values.
Use separate files for your global variables and their values. See 
Organize files by resource type and purpose
.
Identify sensitive fields in variable definitions with the 
sensitive
 keyword so that it doesn't appear in the Terraform output:
variable
 "private_key" 
{
description
=
"Client authentication information"
sensitive
=
true
}
Note:
 Variables that are tagged as sensitive can't be used in loops. For more information on the 
for_each
 command, see 
Reduce code duplication with loops
.
Don't put secret values in a git repository or other source code control system. Anyone with access to a clone of the repository can access the secrets. To prevent saving secrets to the repository, add files that contain secrets to the git ignore file (
.gitignore
).
Don't store secrets in plain text in variable values files.
Use key vault solutions that integrate with Terraform, such as the key vaults for each cloud provider or other key management products.
Define secrets in system environment variables and reference them from Terraform. Set a system environment variable in a setup script with the prefix 
TF_VAR_
. For related information, see 
the Terraform article on environment variables
(opens new window)
.
For example, for a variable 
private_key
:
export
TF_VAR_private_key
=
My_Example_Key_Value
Define a variable with an empty value, then reference it from the environment variable using the standard syntax: the 
var
 keyword followed by a period, followed by the variable name:
variable
 "private_key" 
{
}
provider
 "okta" 
{
org_name
=
 var.okta_org_name
base_url
=
 var.base_url
client_id
=
 var.client_id
scopes
=
 var.scopes
private_key
=
 var.private_key
}
Don't store Terraform state files locally, which is the default. These generated files can leak your credentials. Instead, use remote cloud storage. See the 
Terraform documentation about remote backends
(opens new window)
.
For more strategies for secret storage in Terraform, see this 
third-party article
(opens new window)
.
There are several ways to authenticate with Okta from Terraform and other SDKs. Okta recommends using key pairs. See 
Enable Terraform access for your Okta org
. Okta also recommends using public/private key pairs instead of API keys, which work for authentication from external tools. Store the private key securely with one of the mechanisms described in this article to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. For related discussion, see 
Why You Should Migrate to OAuth 2.0 From Static API Tokens
(opens new window)
.
Avoid problems caused by configuration drift 
The real-world state of your infrastructure can differ from the state files updated during a 
terraform apply
 command. When this occurs, it's called 
configuration drift
.
Configuration drift usually occurs when an org uses multiple strategies or tools to modify resources. External factors can also cause drift. These include a resource unexpectedly terminating, failing, or being out of sync with the Terraform-based resource definitions and state files.
For Okta resources that you manage with Terraform, 
never
 modify them with Admin Console or other APIs.
Create a basic Okta Terraform configuration 
A basic configuration includes the following files in the root of your Terraform directory.
Set up the Okta provider in your main configuration file 
Set up your Terraform provider for your project with code such as the following.
terraform
{
required_providers
{
okta
=
{
source
=
"okta/okta"
version
=
"~> 4.1.0"
}
}
}
provider
 "okta" 
{
org_name
=
 var.okta_org_name
base_url
=
 var.base_url
client_id
=
 var.client_id
scopes
=
 var.scopes
private_key
=
 var.private_key
}
This example sets the required major and minor release version of the Okta Terraform provider using the 
~>
 operator in the 
version
 statement. Terraform supports automatic upgrades based on the build number. Using an explicit version number avoids unexpected Terraform provider upgrades. After each release, choose when to upgrade your configuration with the latest Okta Terraform provider. See the 
Version Constraints guide for Terraform
(opens new window)
.
Use variables and variable values 
Variable values can be set in multiple ways to make them available in your Terraform files. For example, you can set OS environment variables, Just-In-Time variable drop-ins, or variables in container tools, such as Docker. This article demonstrates using standard Terraform variable definitions with their values in 
.tfvars
 files. This approach is typical for initial work with Terraform but isn't recommended for sensitive values. Always follow your organization's best practices for securely setting Terraform variables for production systems and values for sensitive fields.
Important:
 Including sensitive values in your 
.tf
 files, such as provider details or private keys, is a significant security risk. See 
Securely store secrets and credentials
.
Set global variables 
Save your global variables in a file named 
variables.tf
 in the same folder as your 
main.tf
 file:
variable
 "OKTA_ORG_NAME" 
{
description
=
"Name of Okta org"
type
=
 string
}
variable
 "client_id" 
{
description
=
"Client ID value"
sensitive
=
true
}
variable
 "private_key" 
{
description
=
"Client authentication information"
sensitive
=
true
}
variable
 "scopes" 
{
description
=
"Scopes for the client"
type
=
 list(string)
}
Set global variable values in .auto.tfvars files 
Save your global values in a file named 
values.auto.tfvars
 in the same folder as your 
main.tf
 file. To avoid using a special CLI attribute for your Terraform commands to load the files, use the 
.auto.tfvars
 suffix instead of just 
.tfvars
. For example, 
values.auto.tfvars
.
These files can assign variables with a straightforward syntax. See the 
Terraform article on variables
(opens new window)
. For example:
client_id
=
"my-example-client-id"
OKTA_ORG_NAME
=
"ExampleOrg"
Take extra steps to secure variables that hold secrets and credentials. See 
Securely store secrets and credentials
.
Use variables 
Reference a variable by its name in other places in your configuration with the 
var.
 prefix, for example:
resource 
"okta_group"
"Finance"
{
name
=
"
$
{
var
.
OKTA_ORG_NAME
}
-Finance"
description
=
"Finance"
}
Manage your list of API scopes 
Your Terraform configuration must include a list of the Okta API scopes required to perform the associated tasks. For example, Terraform needs the 
okta.groups.manage
 API scope to create a group in the org's directory. See the 
scopes reference
 for more information.
Define a 
scopes
 variable in your 
main.tf
 file:
variable
 "scopes" 
{
description
=
"Scopes for the client"
type
=
 list(string)
}
In your 
values.auto.tfvars
 file, set the 
scopes
 variable value to the scopes you need, for example:
# This list of scopes must match the set of scopes
# required to manage the included Okta resource types
scopes
=
[
"okta.groups.manage"
,
"okta.users.manage"
,
"okta.apps.read"
,
"okta.policies.manage"
,
"okta.authenticators.manage"
]
In your Okta Terraform provider setup, reference your 
var.scopes
 variable:
provider
 "okta" 
{
org_name
=
"exampleorg"
base_url
=
"oktapreview.com"
client_id
=
"0oae98s6dfnqwkj1sa1d7"
scopes
=
 var.scopes
private_key
=
"./keys/terraform-app-private-key.pem"
}
As you add other resource types to Terraform, make changes in multiple places:
Review the 
reference of Okta admin scopes
. Look for scopes that mention that resource. For full read/write access, choose the scope with 
manage
 in the name. For example, add 
okta.groups.manage
 to manage groups.
Enable new scopes on the app that controls your Terraform integration:
Go to 
Applications
 > 
Applications
.
Open the API Service app that controls your Terraform integration.
Click 
Okta API Scopes
.
Find the new scope. If it hasn't already been granted, click 
Grant
 and then click 
Grant Access
.
Update the requested scopes list in your 
values.auto.tfvars
 file.
You may also need to add admin roles to your API service app for Terraform. Enable groups of permissions by department or role in the organization. Use the Admin Console to apply common permissions groups by assigning standard admin roles, such as org admin or super admin. For fine-grained access control, create a custom role and include only the minimal set of permissions. Note that admin roles (which encapsulate permissions) differ from the API scopes. For instructions, see 
Enable Terraform access for your Okta organization
