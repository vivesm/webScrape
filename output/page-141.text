    Publish an OIN integration
The Okta Integration Network (OIN) is the identity industry's broadest and deepest set of pre-built cloud integrations to manage access management, authentication, and provisioning. Gain exposure to thousands of Okta customers who can discover your integration by adding it to the OIN.
OIN integrations speed adoption by simplifying admin configuration steps and reducing friction for your customers. They can integrate your application to Okta with minimal effort.
If you're an integrator, from an independent software vendor (ISV) or an existing Okta customer, who wants to add your integration to the OIN, use this guide to learn about the submission process. It's free to submit and list your integration publicly in the 
OIN catalog
(opens new window)
.
Submission process 
Okta introduced a seamless experience to submit SSO and SCIM integrations for OIN publication. This experience enables you to build and test your integration before submission directly from the Admin Console with the 
OIN Wizard
. This reduces the tools that you need to build, test, and submit your integration. Moreover, it reduces the time needed for the OIN team to review and validate your integration, which shortens the time to publish in the OIN.
You can also submit updates to a previously published SSO or SCIM integration in the OIN Wizard.
For Workflows connector or API service integrations, you need to use the 
OIN Manager
(opens new window)
 for submission.
Note:
 Okta recommends that you:
Separate environments for development, testing, and production.
Use the Okta Developer Edition org as part of your development and testing environment.
Submit your integration to the OIN from the same Okta Developer Edition org.
Don't connect the generated app instance in your Okta Developer Edition org to your production environment.
Before you submit your integration, in either the OIN Wizard or OIN Manager, review the 
OIN submission requirements
 and prepare the necessary artifacts (such as the app logo, description, and configuration document).
Consider the following questions to help you choose which pathway to use for submission:
Are you submitting a new or published SSO or SCIM integrations?
Use the OIN Wizard
.
Note:
 Published SSO or SCIM integrations that were submitted through the OIN Manager have been moved to the OIN Wizard and appear in the 
Your OIN Integrations
 dashboard.
Are you submitting a new or published Workflows integration?
Use the OIN Manager for Workflows integrations
.
Are you submitting a new or published API service integration?
Use the OIN Manager for API services
.
Submit your integration to Okta and work with the OIN team as they test and review your submission. If the OIN team identifies any issues in the review and QA testing phases, you're sent an email with the specific details. At any point in the process, you can check the status of your submission in the OIN Wizard or OIN Manager.
The Okta OIN team reviews and prioritizes all submissions.

Protocols supported 
Okta accepts integrations that use the following protocols or tools into the OIN:
OpenID Connect (OIDC)
(opens new window)
Notes:
To support the potentially large number of Okta orgs that access an authorization server through the OIN, an OIDC integration can't use a custom authorization server, including the 
default
 server.
ISVs shouldn't rely on the 
email_verified
 scope-dependent claim returned by an OIDC integration to evaluate whether a user has verified ownership of the email address associated with their profile.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
(opens new window)
Note:
 SAML integrations must use SHA256 encryption for security. If you're using SHA-1 for encryption, see our guide on how to 
Upgrade SAML Apps to SHA256
.
System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
(opens new window)
Note:
 All integrations in the OIN catalog are public. If you want to create a private integration for an app that uses SCIM, see 
Add a private SCIM integration
.
Workflows Connector Builder
(opens new window)
OAuth 2.0
 (for Okta management service apps, see 
Build an API service integration
)
Note:
 SWA app integrations are no longer accepted for publication in the OIN catalog. However, the OIN team still maintains existing SWA apps.
Submission support 
Getting your app integration in the OIN catalog involves two phases: creating a functional integration and submitting it through the OIN publication process. For each phase in the process, Okta has an associated support stream to assist you.
Create an integration phase
