Sample code 
Customization example
About email customization 
You can customize and style the default email notifications that Okta sends to end users. Okta sends email notifications for various reasons, such as:
User activation
Forgotten password
Unknown device notification
Okta bases email notifications on templates that Okta generates automatically. The templates are available in each Okta-supported language. You can use the default email templates or edit them to send custom messages to end users. End users receive the emails based on your settings.
Note:
 When you edit a template, Okta stops sending the default in other languages. You're responsible for adding translations of your customized message. See 
Edit a default template
.
Multibrand customizations and emails 
If you want to use the Admin Console to send a branded email, consider the following:
If your org has two or more custom brands, domains, and email addresses:
You can't send branded emails from the Admin Console. Okta uses the request host in the URL to determine which brand and email address to use. The Admin Console only works with the Okta subdomain.
Use an Okta API to trigger the email. To send a User Activation email, send a request to the 
Activate a User
(opens new window)
 endpoint. Remember to change the domain of your request to the custom domain that's associated with the brand. For example, change 
subdomain.okta.com
 to 
custom.domain.one
.
If your org has one custom brand, domain, and email address:
Okta doesn't use your custom email address. The Okta subdomain appears in the 
From
 line.
Your theming appears in the content of the email (logo, palette, images). With a single custom brand or domain, the Admin Console assumes that you want to send themed content.
If your org doesn't have a custom brand, domain, and email address, you can only trigger Okta-branded emails from the Admin Console.
See 
Brands
.
Use the Brands API 
The 
Brands API
(opens new window)
 allows you to customize the look and feel of pages and templates, including:
The custom sign-in page
Error pages
Email templates
The Okta End-User Dashboard
You can brand these pages and templates without setting up a customized Okta URL domain.
Note:
 If you change any email code using the 
Admin Console
, your customizations may override the values of the Theme objects. To get your Theme object values back, reset the code editors in the Admin Console to the default settings.
See 
Custom Email Templates
(opens new window)
 for details about email templates and the Brands API.
Caveats 
Email templates must be under 64 KB. This is approximately 65,000 single-byte characters for all text, HTML, and CSS characters in the template. UTF-8 characters can be as large as 4 bytes each, so Okta accepts fewer characters.
Okta supports only inline CSS.
The 
Subject
 can't exceed 128 characters.
If you customize an email template, you need to manually create a translation for each additional language that you support in your org.
Edit a default email template 
Use these steps to add or edit a template in one of the Okta-supported languages.
Note:
 To access email customization with a free Okta Developer Edition org, contact 
Okta support
(opens new window)
.
In the Admin Console, go to 
Customizations
 > 
Brands
, and then select the brand you want.
On the 
Emails
 tab, click an email template name:
The code editor is in preview mode.
Audience
: Select the email audience: 
All users
, 
Admin only
, or 
Disabled for all
.
Translations
: Customize email template translations. See 
Add translations
.
Language
: Select the default language for the email template. See 
Add translations
.
Subject
: The subject line for the template in the default language. You can edit the subject line when the template is in read/write mode.
In the preview window, to see a translation of a customized template, select a language from the dropdown menu. See 
Add translations
.
Click 
Edit
 to put the editor in read/write mode.
Make changes directly in the editor. If you type 
$
, 
#
, or 
{
, the editor provides a list of available variables that you can use. See 
Use Velocity Templating Language (VTL)
.
Click the code editor to full-screen mode.
Click 
Save changes
, then click 
Preview
 to see your changes before you publish.
Click 
Reset template
 to remove your customizations and restore the default HTML/CSS.
Click 
Save changes
. The default language version of your edited message appears in the 
Email Templates
 table.
Remember that Okta doesn't automatically translate the changes you make in one template to the other language templates. To add translations for this customization, proceed to step 3 in 
Add translations
.
Use customizable email templates 
The following table provides a list of all available email templates in an Okta org, including:
The default subject line for the email template
The corresponding API object reference (
{templateName}
) for the email template. See 
Custom email templates
(opens new window)
.
The required validation fields for templates created using the API
A description of the template
Note:
 If you use the embedded Okta Sign-In Widget for authentication, don't use 
{emailAuthenticationLink}
 as the required validation field. It takes you to the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget. Instead, use 
Custom password recovery
.

Add translations 
You can edit the templates through the pencil icon. See 
Edit a default email template
.
If you restore an email to default settings, you delete any customizations made to the email whether the customization is for the default language.
After you customize a template in one language, you need to customize templates for other languages if you want to include them. If you reset all customized translations, then Okta uses the 27 default translations.
The following settings determine the language for emails sent from Okta to a user, if the user hasn't selected a specific display language:
The user's locale property value (if specified)
The org's display language

Enable other locales 
 Early Access
Use the 
BCP 47 format
(opens new window)
 to enable more locales than Okta's 27 default languages.
You can only create customizations using these other languages by calling the Brands API. Once created, the new locale appears in the Admin Console along with the default-supported locales. See 
Create an Email Customization
(opens new window)
.
Include 
null
 in the subject or body of the email customization. Okta replaces 
null
 with a default value based on the following order of priority:
An existing default email customization, if one exists
Okta-provided translated content for the specified language, if one exists
Okta-provided translated content for the brand locale, if it's set
Okta-provided content in English
If you use functions while adding more locales, use the 
getTimeDiffHoursNow
 function instead of the 
formatTimeDiffHoursNowInUserLocale
 function. 
getTimeDiffHoursNow
 returns only the time value in the specified unit. See 
Use functions for email templates
.
Use the Admin Console 
In the Admin Console, go to 
Customizations
 > 
Brands
.
Select a brand.
Click 
Emails
.
In the 
Email Templates
 box, select an email template that youâ€™ve customized.
The code editor is in preview mode and shows the default language version.

.
Language
: Select the default language for the email template:
Click

.
From the dropdown menu, select one of your existing translated customizations.
Click

.
Note:
 This setting only applies to the current email. You must set the default language separately for each translated template.
To delete all custom translations and revert to the Okta template, click 
Reset to Default
.
Use Velocity Templating Language 
Velocity Templating Language (VTL)
(opens new window)
 allows you to customize your org's email templates so that you can use the following:
Enhanced conditional logic
All attributes in the Okta 
User Profile object
(opens new window)
Some of the org attributes in the VTL variables
Email templates use both common and unique VTL variables. When you interpolate variables in the template, precede them with a dollar sign. Use dot notation to reference subobjects. For example, reference the first name of a user with 
${user.profile.firstName}
.
See 
Use VTL variables
 for available email template variables.
Use conditional logic 
In your email templates, you can use any conditional logic that VTL supports, such as 
if
, 
elseif
, or 
else
 constructs and 
foreach
 loops. See the 
Velocity documentation
(opens new window)
.
Customization example 
The following example uses the 
${app.name}
 variable, which is only available in Identity Engine.
#if(${app.name} == "Toys R' Fun")

Use functions for email templates 
In addition to variables, you can use the following functions in each of the email templates. Functions normalize the dynamic output of variables. For example, you can lowercase a string or produce a localized date for the end user.
Variables used for function parameters must match the function data type. For example, you can't use a string variable with the 
formatTimeDiffHourNow()
 function. The parameter data must be an integer.
The format of the function must be as follows:
${f.function()}
Here are some examples:
Replace function: This example replaces the word 
User
 with 
John
 resulting in 
"Hello, John!"
:
${replace("Hello, User!", "User", "John")}
Substring after function: This example returns the substring after the 
@
 character, resulting in 
example.com
:
${substringAfter("user@example.com", "@")}
To lower case function: This example converts the string 
HELLO WORLD
 to all lowercase, resulting in 
hello world
:
${toLowerCase("HELLO WORLD")}
Expression
Definition
${replace(String input, String matchString, String replacement)}
Replaces all occurrences of the match string with the replacement string
${substringAfter(String input, String matchString)}
Returns the input substring after the occurrence of a given match string. Or returns an empty string if no occurrence of the match string exists in the input string.
${substringBefore(String input, String matchString)}
Returns the input substring before the occurrence of a given match string. Or returns an empty string if no occurrence of the match string exists in the input string.
${toLowerCase(String input)}
Converts the given input string to all lowercase
${toUpperCase(String input)}
Converts the given input string to all uppercase
${substring(String input, int startIndex, int endIndex)}
Extracts a range of characters from the given input string
${formatTimeDiffHoursNow(int hours)}
Produces a formatted duration string from the current time to the given number of hours
${formatTimeDiffHoursNowInUserLocale(int hours)}
Produces a localized formatted duration string for the given number of hours
${formatTimeDiffDateNow(Date date)}
Produces a formatted duration string for the given date
${formatTimeDiffDateNowInUserLocale(Date date)}
Produces a localized formatted duration string for the given date
${escapeHtml(String html)}
Escapes the characters in the provided string using HTML entities
${escapeHtmlAttr(String html)}
Encodes data for use in HTML attributes
${getTimeDiffHoursNow(int hours, String timeUnit)}
Produces a duration string for the given number of hours converted to the specified time units. Supported string values for the timeUnit argument are milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, and years.
Test your custom email templates 
You can send yourself a test email to see how a custom email template looks and functions. A test email can help you validate attribute-based variables and translations in the customized template. You can see how the template renders in different email environments and avoid creating end-to-end workflows to test customizations. The primary email address of the admin that initiates the test receives the email.
Click the email icon to the right of the email template that youâ€™ve customized. A list shows the sender and receiver of the email.
Click 
Send test email
.
Known Issues 
Users with free.fr email addresses may not receive emails delivered by Okta. This is due to free.fr enforcing non-standard email processing. The Okta Org API allows you to 
retry blocked
(opens new window)
 emails, but the free.fr inbox provider continues to block retries. Thereâ€™s no known workaround beyond asking the user to retrigger the email with a different email address.
