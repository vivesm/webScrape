    Configure Swift SDK redirect authentication
Control access to the storage used by the redirect authentication session, such as cookies that are used to remember the device.
Overview 
The redirect authentication method in the Swift SDK opens a browser window in your app for the sign-on flow. The browser is opened using an Apple API for secure authentication.
One option controls if the secure browser session saves data, such as cookies, to the user's regular browser. The default setting for the Swift SDK enables sharing that data. Apple privacy measures require user consent to share that data, which results in the system asking for consent before displaying the browser. This occurs for both the sign-in and sign-out flows.
For example, this dialog asks the user to allow any information from the authorization provider 
myapp.okta.com
 with the app My App:
Configure the secure session 
Use the 
ephemeralSession
 property of the 
WebAuthentication
 class to control sharing data between the secure session and the user's regular browser. The default value is 
false
.
To avoid a confirmation dialog, set 
ephemeralSession
 to 
true
 before calling 
signIn
. However, this also prevents Single Sign-On (SSO) and has other effects:
ephemeralSession
Remember device
SSO
Authenticate each time

Sign out the user 
There are two steps to sign out a user completely when 
ephemeralSession
 is set to 
false
:
Call the 
signOut(from:credential:options:)
 or 
signOut(from:credential:options:completion:)
 function of the 
WebAuthentication
 class to invalidate the browser window session.
Call the 
remove()
 function of the 
Credential
 class to remove any existing authentication tokens.
If you don't do this then when the user next authenticates the token may be updated without requiring any factors. The user experiences this as an immediate authentication to the last account from which they signed out.
