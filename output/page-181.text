    Identity Engine
Note:
 This document is only for Identity Engine. If you’re using Classic Engine, see 
Sign in to SPA with Auth JS
. See 
Identify your Okta solution

 to determine your Okta version.
This guide discusses building a password sign-in Angular app that uses the Okta Auth JS and Angular libraries for Okta 
embedded authentication
.
Learning outcomes 
Understand the sequence of steps required to implement 
embedded authentication
 with Okta Auth JS and Angular libraries for your Angular app.
What you need 
Okta Developer Edition organization
Okta Angular Identity Engine Sample App
(opens new window)
Note
: Use the latest version of the Okta libraries for your Angular app.
About using Okta Auth JS with your SPA app 
You can retain authentication control of your Angular single-page app (SPA) without redirection to Okta by implementing 
embedded authentication
. Use embedded authentication with the Auth JS SDK. This library provides you with common, reusable OAuth 2.0 methods and properties to handle the interaction between the authorization server and your client app.
You can customize the sign-in experience for your app with minimal use of low-level 
Okta Authentication
 and 
Okta OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0
 APIs.
The authentication interaction between the authorization server and your client app follows the 
Interaction Code
 flow. This flow is an extension to the 
OAuth 2.0 and OIDC
 standard. It allows you to customize the user authentication experience for your app without redirecting to an authentication component outside of your app. See 
Implement authorization by Interaction Code grant type
 to understand the Interaction Code flow and necessary interactions between the authorization server and your app.
Note
: You can use the 
Okta Sign-In Widget
 to embed authentication if you don't need full customization capabilities for your sign-in user experience. The Sign-In Widget handles the Interaction Code flow in authentication use cases offered by Okta. See 
Sign in to your SPA with the embedded Okta Sign-In Widget
.
Create an Okta app integration 
Before you integrate authentication into your Angular app, you need to register your app in your Okta org. This provides you with the OpenID Connect client ID for authentication requests from your app. Register your app by creating an app integration through the 
Okta CLI
(opens new window)
, the 
Okta Apps API
(opens new window)
, or the 
Admin Console
 with the following steps:
To create an app integration for your Angular app, sign in to 
your Admin Console
(opens new window)
.
Select 
Applications
 > 
Applications
, and then click 
Create App Integration
.
In the dialog that appears, select 
OIDC - OpenID Connect
 as the 
Sign-on method
, 
Single-Page Application
 as the 
Application type
, and then click 
Next
.
Fill in the following new app integration settings, and then click 
Save
:
Setting
Value/Description
App integration name
Specify a unique name for your app.
Grant types
Leave 
Authorization Code
 selected, and then select 
Refresh Token
. Click 
Advanced
 and select 
Interaction Code
.
Sign-in redirect URIs
Specify your app URI for the callback redirect from Okta. For example, 
http://localhost:4200/login/callback
.
Sign-out redirect URIs
Specify your app sign-out redirect URI. For example: 
http://localhost:4200
. Ensure that you add all your deployment URIs.
Trusted Origins > Base URIs
Specify your app base URI for CORS. For example: 
http://localhost:4200
. Ensure that you add trusted origins for all base URIs.
Assignments
Assign users to your app.
Note:
 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is automatically enabled for the Trusted Origins base URI that you specified in the Admin Console. If you're using the 
Okta CLI
(opens new window)
 to create your SPA Okta app integration, CORS is also automatically enabled for your base URI. You can verify that both 
CORS
 and 
redirect
 are enabled for your app by reviewing the 
Security
 > 
API
 > 
Trusted Origins
 page in the Admin Console.
App integration settings 
You need two pieces of information from your org and app integration for your Angular app:
Client ID
: From the 
General
 tab of your app integration, save the generated 
Client ID
 value.
Issuer
: From the 
General
 tab of your app integration, save the 
Okta domain
 value. Use your Okta domain value for the 
issuer
 setting, which represents the authorization server. Use 
https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
 as the issuer for your app if you're using the Okta Developer Edition org. See 
Issuer configuration
 if you want to use another Okta custom authorization server.
Install the SDK 
Download the sample Angular application 
To view a simple example of an Angular app, clone the Okta Angular Identity Engine sample app and follow the setup procedure:
Clone the Angular sample repository 
Clone the Okta Angular sample app repository and navigate to the top-level folder.
git
 clone git@github.com:okta-samples/okta-angular-oie-sample-quickstart.git
cd
 okta-angular-oie-sample-quickstart
Install the dependencies 
Install the dependencies in the 
okta-angular-oie-sample-quickstart
 folder:
npm
 ci
Update the application configuration file 
Update the configuration file of the sample app (
src/app/okta-config.ts 
) in the project root folder. The 
okta-config.ts
 file contains the configuration values for your app integration. See 
Create an Okta app integration
 for details on these values.
const
 oidcConfig 
=
{
clientId
:
'{clientId}'
,
issuer
:
'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
,
scopes
:
[
'openid'
,
'offline_access'
,
'profile'
,
'email'
]
,
pkce
:
true
}
;
Run the sample application 
Navigate to the project folder and run the sample application.
cd
 okta-angular-oie-sample-quickstart
npm
 start
Open a new browser and navigate to the default local host port (
http://localhost:4200
). Click 
Login
 and sign in with a user from your org. After a successful authentication, the user's ID token appears on the page.
Create an Angular app (optional) 
To create an Angular app, open a terminal and install the Angular CLI:
npm
install
-g
 @angular/cli
Now, create an app using the Angular CLI:
ng new okta-app
When asked 
Would you like to add Angular routing?
, press 
y
.
After all prompts are answered, the Angular CLI creates a project in a folder named 
okta-app
 and installs all required dependencies.
cd
 okta-app
Install the 
Okta Auth SDK
(opens new window)
 using 
npm
:
npm
install
 @okta/okta-auth-js
Basic sign-in flow 
Build a sign-in page that captures both the username and password. As an example, see the app component files such as 
app.component.html
 and 
app.component.ts
 that generate a dynamic form in the sample application.
From the 
app.component.html
 file:
<
main
>
<
app-menu
[isAuthenticated]
=
"
(isAuthenticated$ | async) ?? false
"
(startFlow)
=
"
onFlow($event)
"
(logout)
=
"
onLogout()
"
>
</
app-menu
>
<
ng-container
*ngIf
=
"
idxMessages$ | async as messages
"
>
<
div
>
<
p
*ngFor
=
"
let message of messages
"
>
{{message.message}}
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
ng-container
>
<
ng-container
*ngIf
=
"
nextStep$ | async as nextStep
"
>
<
app-okta-dynamic-form
*ngIf
=
"
!(isAuthenticated$ | async)
"
[nextStep]
=
"
nextStep
"
(userInput)
=
"
onInput($event)
"
>
</
app-okta-dynamic-form
>
</
ng-container
>
<
ng-container
*ngIf
=
"

The dynamic form works with the 
Interaction code
 flow to convert the 
NextStep
 response into appropriate form fields. Review the 
dynamic-form.component
 and 
form-transformer.service.ts
 files for code details. See also 
Next Step

.
Note:
 This guide only reviews the sign-in use case of the sample app.
Review the simple password-only sign-in use case from the sample app. This use case is outlined in the following sequence diagram with your single-page app as the client:
Review the Okta configuration settings 
Review the 
src/app/okta-config.ts
 file that references the required 
app integration settings
 to initialize your Auth JS instance. The 
okta-config.ts
 file references the values from your app integration.
import
{
 OktaAuth 
}
from
'@okta/okta-auth-js'
;
import
{
 FactoryProvider
,
 InjectionToken 
}
from
'@angular/core'
;
import
{
DOCUMENT
}
from
'@angular/common'
;
import
{
 Router 
}
from
'@angular/router'
;
const
 oidcConfig 
=
{
  clientId
:
'{clientId}'
,
  issuer
:
'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
,
  scopes
:
[
'openid'
,
'profile'
,
'email'
]
,
  pkce
:
true
}
;
Instantiate the Okta Auth JS client 
Review the same Angular 
src/app/okta-config.ts
 file that imports required libraries and instantiates the Okta Auth JS client with values from the 
oidcConfig
 variable.
import
{
 OktaAuth 
}
from
'@okta/okta-auth-js'
;
import
{
 FactoryProvider
,
 InjectionToken 
}
from
'@angular/core'
;
import
{
DOCUMENT
}
from
'@angular/common'
;
import
{
 Router 
}
from
'@angular/router'
;
const
 oidcConfig 
=
{
  clientId
:
'{clientId}'
,
  issuer
:
'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
,
  scopes
:
[
'openid'
,
'profile'
,
'email'
]
,
  pkce
:
true
}
;
export
const
OKTA_AUTH
=
new
InjectionToken
(
'okta-auth'
)
;
const
oktaAuthFactory
=
(
router
:
 Router
,
 doc
:
any
)
=>
{
const
 params 
=
 router
.
parseUrl
(
doc
.
location
.
search
)
;
const
 state 
=
 params
.
queryParamMap
.
get
(
'state'
)
??
undefined
;
const
 recoveryToken 
=
 params
.
queryParamMap
.
get
(
'recoveryToken'
)
??
undefined
;
const
 redirectUri 
=
`
{doc.location.origin}/login/callback
`
;
return
new
OktaAuth
(
{
...
oidcConfig
,
 redirectUri
,
 state
,
 recoveryToken
}
)
}
;
export
const
OKTA_PROVIDER
:
 FactoryProvider 
=
{
  provide
:
OKTA_AUTH
,
  useFactory
:
 oktaAuthFactory
,
  deps
:
[
Router
,
DOCUMENT
]
}
To start the Okta Auth JS service, see this code snippet from the 
okta-auth-service.ts
 file:
import
{
OKTA_AUTH
}
from
'./okta-config'
;
constructor
(
@
Inject
(
OKTA_AUTH
)
private
 oktaAuth
:
 OktaAuth
)
{
this
.
oktaAuth
.
start
(
)
;
}
Handle the password authentication 
Review the 
okta-auth.service.ts
 file for details on handling a successful password authentication by receiving the 
SUCCESS
 status, which also returns tokens. For example, for the simple authentication case:
public
authenticateFlow
(
)
:
 Observable
<
NextStep 
|
undefined
>
{
return
defer
(
(
)
=>
this
.
oktaAuth
.
idx
.
authenticate
(
)
.
pipe
(
tap
(
 transaction 
=>
{
if
(
transaction
.
status 
===
 IdxStatus
.
SUCCESS
&&
!
!
transaction
.
tokens
)
{
this
.
oktaAuth
.
tokenManager
.
setToken
(
transaction
.
tokens
)
;
}
}
)
,
map
(
 transaction 
=>
{
const
 status 
=
 transaction
.
status
;
if
(
status 
===
 IdxStatus
.
SUCCESS
||
 status 
===
 IdxStatus
.
CANCELED
)
{
return
undefined
;
}
if
(
status 
===
 Idx
.
FAILURE
)
throw
'Idx error'
;
return
 transaction
.
nextStep
;
}
)
;
}
The sample app includes other flow states and authentication:
...
.
export
type
FLOW_TYPE
=
'authenticate'
|
'recoverPassword'
|
'register'
|
'idp'
;
...
.
public
startIdxFlow
(
flow
:
FLOW_TYPE
)
:
 Observable
<
NextStep 
|
undefined
>
{
return
defer
(
(
)
=>
 flow 
===
'idp'
?
this
.
oktaAuth
.
idx
.
startTransaction
(
)
:
this
.
oktaAuth
.
idx
[
flow
]
(
)
)
.
pipe
(
map
(
transaction 
=>
this
.
transactionStateHandler
(
transaction
)
)
)
;
}
...
.
private
transactionStateHandler
(
transaction
:
 IdxTransaction
)
:
 NextStep 
|
undefined
{
const
 appState 
=
this
.
appAuthStateSub$
.
getValue
(
)
;
this
.
appAuthStateSub$
.
next
(
{
...
appState
,
 transaction
}
)
;
const
 status 
=
 transaction
.
status
;
if
(
status 
===
 IdxStatus
.
SUCCESS
||
 status 
===
 IdxStatus
.
CANCELED
)
{
return
undefined
;
}
if
(
transaction
.
status 
===
 IdxStatus
.
FAILURE
)
{
throw
'Idx error'
;
}
return
 transaction
.
nextStep
;
}
Next steps 
After you create a basic sign-in flow for your Angular app, you can extend your app's sign-in experience. You can add features such as Multifactor Authentication, self-registration, or social IdP authentication.
For each of those features, ensure you understand the 
Interaction Code flow
 so that you can handle possible remediation steps of the interaction. In addition to implementing the remediation steps for those features in your app code, you need to configure authenticators and authentication policies for your app.
To use the SDK to implement these features, see the 
Okta Auth JS SDK Interaction Code reference
(opens new window)
.
To set up your Okta org for these use cases, see:
Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case
Set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case
Note:
 The Admin Console and the Okta API support the Identity Engine org configuration.
