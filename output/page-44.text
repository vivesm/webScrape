About the Okta Sign-On and app sign-on policies 
An Okta sign-on policy helps you control who can sign in and how a user is allowed to sign in to Okta. Sign-on policies control whether users are challenged for MFA and how long they’re allowed to remain signed in before reauthenticating. You can also configure app sign-on policies for each app for extra levels of authentication before an app can be accessed.
Add a rule to the Okta sign-on policy. For example, add a rule that ensures that only users who are inside your 
corporate network
(opens new window)
 can access your app. Or add a rule that excludes certain roles in your org from accessing your app. Add a rule for an app sign-on policy, for example, to prompt groups that are assigned to your app to reauthenticate after 60 minutes. There’s only one app sign-on policy, but you can add as many rules to it as you need.
You can specify any number of Okta sign-on policies and the order in which they’re executed. If a policy in the list doesn't apply to the user trying to sign in, the system moves to the next policy. There’s one required org-wide policy named 
Default
. By definition, the default policy applies to all users.
In addition to the default policy, which you can't delete, there may be another org-wide policy named 
Legacy
. That policy is present only if you have already configured MFA. This policy reflects the MFA settings that were in place when you enabled your sign-on policy. And it ensures that no changes in MFA behavior occur unless you modify your policy. If required, you can delete it.
Note:
 See 
Policies
 for an overview of the supported Okta policies and how they work.
Configure sign-on policies for common scenarios 
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure an Okta sign-on policy and an app sign-on policy for two of the most common scenarios:
Prompt for an MFA factor for a certain group
Prompt for an MFA factor when a user is outside the US
Prompt for an MFA factor for a certain group 
The following are step-by-step instructions to configure an Okta sign-on policy. Use this policy to prompt a user for Multifactor Authentication (MFA) when the user is a member of a certain group.
Create the policy container 
In the Admin Console, go to 
Security
 > 
Authentication
.
Click the 
Sign On
 tab, and then click 
Add New Okta Sign-on Policy
.
In the 
Add Policy
 window, enter a 
Policy Name
, such as 
Require MFA for Contractors
, and then enter a 
Policy Description
.
In the 
Assign to Groups
 box, enter the group name that you want to apply the policy to. In this example, specify the 
Contractor
 group in your org. You must create the group before assigning it to the policy.
Click 
Create Policy and Add Rule
.
Create the rule 
In the 
Add Rule
 window, add a descriptive name for the rule in the 
Rule name
 box. For example, name it as 
Require contractors to use MFA once per session
.
If there are any users in the 
Contractor
 group that you want to exclude from the rule, enter them in the 
Exclude Users
 box.
For this use case example, leave the default of 
Anywhere
 in the 
If User's IP is
 dropdown box. For other use cases where you want to assign location parameters, you can specify what kind of location prompts authentication. For example, you can prompt a user for a factor when they aren't on the corporate network.
Note:
 You can click the 
Networks
 link to access the gateway settings that enable your choice of access. A 
network zone
(opens new window)
 is a security perimeter used to limit or restrict access to a network based on a single IP address, one or more IP address ranges, or a list of geolocations. You can also create network zones using the 
Zone API
(opens new window)
.
Leave the default of 
Any
 in the 
And Authenticates via
 dropdown box.
Select 
Allowed
 from the 
Then Access is
 dropdown box to allow access based on the conditions defined.
Leave the 
Prompt for Factor
 checkbox selected so that users of the 
Contractor
 group are prompted for a factor before they’re granted access. This checkbox appears only when at least one factor type is enabled in your org.
Note:
 Click the 
Multifactor Authentication
 link for quick access to the 
Authentication
 page and the 
Multifactor
 tab to define the factors that you want to use.
Use the option buttons to determine how users are prompted for MFA in a given session. In this example, leave the default of 
Per Session
 selected.
You can configure whether the factor prompt is triggered per a device, at every sign-on, or per a session time that you specify:
Per Device:
 Provides the option 
Do not challenge me on this device again
 on the end user MFA challenge dialog box. This option allows prompts solely for new devices.
Every Time:
 End users are prompted every time they sign in to Okta and can't influence when they’re prompted to provide a factor.
Per Session:
 Provides the option 
Do not challenge me on this device for the next (minutes/hours/days)
 on the end user MFA challenge dialog box. You can then specify the 
Factor Lifetime
. When specifying per session sessions have a default lifetime as configured, but sessions always end whenever users sign out of their Okta session.
For this use case example, leave the default 
Factor Lifetime
 of 
15 minutes
. Use these fields to specify how much time must elapse before the user is challenged for MFA.
The maximum lifetime period is six months. Setting a factor lifetime is a way for end users to sign out for the amount of time noted in the 
Factor Lifetime
. They don't have to authenticate again with MFA at the next sign in. End users must select a box when they sign in to confirm that the setting should be applied. An example is 
Do not challenge me on this device for the next 15 minutes
. After signing out, there’s no MFA prompt if the user signs in again within 15 minutes of the last sign in with MFA. If users don't select the box, they’re always prompted for MFA. The time since the last sign-in is noted at the bottom of the End-User Dashboard. However, end users must refresh the page to see the updated value.
For this use case example, leave the default 
Session Expires After
 setting of 
2 hours
. Use these fields to specify the maximum idle time before an authentication prompt is triggered. The maximum allowed time for this option is 90 days. This isn't the total connect time. This is idle time before users see a countdown timer at the 5-minute mark of remaining session time.
Note:
 You can set the 
maximum session lifetime value
(opens new window)
 using the Okta APIs. If you previously set this value using the API, you can't exceed that maximum in the UI. Setting a value over the API maximum results in an error.
Click 
Create Rule
.
Note:
 After you create a policy, you must close all active sessions for the new policy to take effect.
Prompt for MFA factor when a user is outside the US 
In addition to the Okta sign-on policy, there’s an app sign-on policy for each app. The app sign-on policy determines the extra levels of authentication that can be performed before a user accesses an app. The following are instructions to configure an app sign-on policy to prompt a user for an MFA factor when they're outside the United States.
Note:
 This example assumes that you have already 
set up a Dynamic Zone
(opens new window)
 for the United States.
Select the App 
In the Admin Console, select 
Applications
 > 
Applications
.
Select the app that you want to configure a sign-on policy for. In this example, use a web app.
Click 
Sign On
 and scroll down to the 
Sign On Policy
 section.
Create the rule and define conditions 
Note:
 Some options described in this section may not be available in your org. To enable them, contact 
Okta Support
(opens new window)
.
Click 
Add Rule
.
Enter a 
Rule Name
 such as 
Prompt for an MFA factor when a user is outside the US
.
Select who the rule applies to in the 
People
 section. In this use case example, select 
The following groups and users:
.
In the 
Groups
 box that appears, enter the group that you want this rule to apply to. In this example, use 
Everyone
. You can also add specific users that you want to include in the 
Users
 box.
If you want to exclude specific groups and users from the policy rule, select 
Exclude the following users and groups from this rule:
 and then specify the groups and users.
Specify the location to which you want the policy to apply in the 
LOCATION
 section of the dialog box. In this example, select 
In Zone
.
In the 
Network Zones
 box that appears, enter the name of the zone that you want to apply. Then add it when it appears in the list. In this example, add a 
network zone
(opens new window)
 for the United States. Create a network zone for the United States if you haven't already.
In the 
CLIENT
 section, clear the platform conditions that you don't want the rule to apply to. In this example, leave the default of all platforms selected.
For this use case, in the 
ACTIONS
 section, leave the default of 
Allowed
 for the 
When all the conditions above are met, sign on to this application is
  dropdown box.
Select the 
Prompt for factor
 checkbox to require users who are outside of the United States to choose an MFA option for extra authentication.
Note:
 The 
Multifactor Settings
 link takes you to the Multifactor Authentication page, where you can add factors.
Then, specify how frequently you want the users to be prompted. Select 
Once per session
 for this use case.
Note:
 While you can configure your app sign-on policies to prompt end users for MFA, legacy protocols such as 
POP
 or 
IMAP
 don't support MFA even if MFA is configured.
Click 
Save
.
