JSON tools by Workato – Parse JSON document action
The
Parse JSON document
action extracts values from raw JSON content and converts them into structured datapills for use in recipes.
#
Input
Input field
Description
Sample document
Provide a sample JSON document that defines the expected structure of the input. Workato uses this to generate the output schema.
Document
Provide the raw JSON content to parse. This must match the structure of the sample document.
Encoding of the file content
Set the encoding format of the JSON string. If left blank, Workato uses
UTF-8
by default.
Edit schema
