YAML tools by Workato – Parse YAML document action
The
Parse YAML document
action extracts values from raw YAML content and converts them into structured datapills for use in recipes. You can use this action to parse full YAML files or YAML headers embedded in other file formats.
#
Input
Input field
Description
Sample YAML document
Provide a sample YAML snippet that defines the structure of your content. Workato uses this to generate the output schema.
YAML content
Provide the actual YAML content to parse. This may come from a downloaded file or the output of a previous step.
DOWNLOAD A YAML FILE
You can use a download action from connectors such as
Dropbox
or
File tools by Workato
to download a YAML file into Workato for this action's input.
#
Output
Workato generates datapills based on the structure defined in the
Sample YAML document
field. These may include strings, lists, nested objects, and arrays.
#
Example usage
This example parses a YAML structure that contains employee records. Each record includes simple fields, arrays, and nested lists or dictionaries.

.
You can also parse metadata stored in YAML headers within other file formats. These YAML headers appear at the top of a file, between
---
lines. For example:
---
title
:
"Edinburgh Biodiversity"
author
:
John Doe
date
:
22/Oct/2016
output
:
html_document
---
The action parses only the YAML block between the boundaries and ignores the rest of the file.
