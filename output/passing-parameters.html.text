Passing parameters
Parameters are additional information to be used in the recipe in the form of datapills.
Defining parameters
in the Workbot trigger block is vital for the parameters to be passed successfully into the recipe, without which there will be no datapills to be used in the recipe actions.
There are two sources for these parameters - the user and another recipe - and four ways these parameters can be passed into the recipe -
line commands
,
buttons
,
task modules
and
pick lists
.
#
Line commands
If the parameters of the recipe are known beforehand, the user can specify them with the Workbot command after a space, with the format parameter1: value1 parameter2: value2 parameter3: value3, etc. An example can be seen in the top right corner of the screenshot below.
Sending a 'newissue' command with additional parameters Urgency, Summary, and Description
#
Buttons
Buttons can be used in either a
post reply
or a
post message
action.
The following table shows what goes into the button fields:
Input field
Description
Button text
Text to be displayed on the button.
Submit button command
Workbot command to execute when button is clicked, for example,
create_ticket
. Only after
configuring the command
in a Workbot for Microsoft Teams trigger block can that command be visible in the drop-down list.
Additional parameters
Parameter values to be passed onto the next recipe when button is clicked, for example,
{
"sys_id": "
sys_id
"
"summary": "
Summary
",
"description": "
Description
"
}
Datapills must be enclosed within double quotes, and parameter names should be entirely lowercase. These parameters can be supplied by users. For example, you can supply parameters such as the urgency of an issue in ServiceNow, or specific recipe details like the Message ID from a previous Microsoft Teams message.
*Supports Markdown
A button can be configured to invoke a Workbot command of another recipe
Parameters in the
Additional parameters
field of Recipe 1 are passed to the parameters defined in Recipe 2, invoked by the command within the
Submit button command
field.
If there are more parameters passed in Recipe 1 than defined in Recipe 2, those extra parameters are not captured by Recipe 2; they are lost.
Conversely, if there are fewer parameters passed in Recipe 1 than defined in Recipe 2, Workbot auto-fills the parameters that passed successfully and launches a
task module
to prompt the user to fill in the missing parameters.
Half-filled task module
#
Task Modules
Task modules are dialog boxes that appear when Workbot needs more parameter values from the user.
Task module dialog box
After the user fills in the required fields, these values are tied to datapills that the recipe can use later on.
Parameters in the datatree
For example, to create an incident in ServiceNow, you may want to prompt users for additional info like
Urgency
,
Summary
, and
Description
. By adding
Urgency
,
Summary
, and
Description
as parameters, Workbot will open a task module and prompt the user for each parameter.
Workbot can ask users for info if you specify additional parameters in your command
#
Picklists
Picklists allow users to choose between a fixed number of options. This is useful when the available options are known, for example, Urgency (High:1, Medium: 2, Low: 3), Priority (1,2,3,4,5), and so on. They are not able to pass parameters on their own and must be paired with either buttons or task modules to do so.
#
Picklists with buttons
Pick lists can be found in the
post reply
and
post message
actions.
The 'Next' button also passes the 'opportunity_id' of 'Google' onto the command recipe that it invokes
The following table shows what goes into the pick list and choice fields:
Input field
Description
Pick list name
Name of pick list. Displays before choices, and supports markdown.
Pick list style
Compact
displays choices in a drop-down menu, while
Expanded
displays all choices with radio buttons.
Choice parameter
Parameter name to store the choice value. This is a required field when passing parameters to another recipe, otherwise the value will not be passed.
Title
Text to display for choice. Cannot contain
:
or
,
.
Value
Value to pass to
Choice parameter
if chosen. Cannot contain
:
or
,
.
*Supports Markdown
The choice parameter will take its value from a choice (if it's chosen)
When the user chooses from the
Choices
available in the picklist, that value is attached to the
Choice parameter
, which can then be passed on to the next recipe. Therefore, while the
Choice parameter
is labeled as optional, it must be defined for the value chosen to have a parameter to attach to. Furthermore, that same parameter must be
defined
in the downstream recipe's trigger block for the
Choice parameter
to be passed successfully.
The user can define only one picklist per
post reply
or
post message
action block, meaning that only one parameter can be passed to the downstream recipe using a pick list.
#
Picklists in task modules
When
defining parameters
in the Workbot for Microsoft Teams trigger block, a picklist is created in the task module when the
Data type
is set to
String
and comma-separated options are added to the
Options
field.
If the display name and the value are different, separate the two by a colon, for example, High:1, Medium:2, Low: 3. That parameter's value thus takes on the option selected by the user and can be used further in the recipe as a datapill; a parameter gets passed through a pick list.
It's important to note that pick list display name and value cannot contain
:
or
,
.
