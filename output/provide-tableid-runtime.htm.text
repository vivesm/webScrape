Provide a table ID at runtime
To use the Table function cards (such as Create Row), you typically select the table that the function will operate on by clicking 
Choose Table
 on the card.
However, you also have the option to run a flow using a table without specifying one in advance.  For example, you could be using a helper flow which gets the table ID from the parent flow when its running.
For those cases, select 
Provide table ID at runtime
. When you choose this option, you will also need to add a value to the 
Table ID
 field.
