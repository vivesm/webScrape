Using the publish message action
The publish action enables you to publish messages to a specific topic in Workato. Other recipes can then pick up all messages published to that topic, using Event streams triggers.
One action publishes one message at a time. The
topic schema
defines the action input fields available here.
Select the topic and fill in the input fields to configure the publish message action
PAYLOAD SIZE LIMITATIONS
Payloads in the
Event streams connector
are limited to 512 KB per message. To publish messages with payloads up to 1 MB, use the
Event streams public API
.
