Docs Copilot
FEATURE AVAILABILITY
Copilot is available for all direct customers across all Workato data centers. It is available to Embedded partners in the admin workspace, but is not available in Embedded customer workspaces. All data is sent to OpenAI's servers in the US. You can opt-in to this feature by agreeing to our
AI feature addendum
(opens new window)
. Contact your Customer Success representative to learn more.
Deploying a recipe to production involves multiple contributors and various activities beyond the building and testing phases. One crucial activity is documenting your recipes using detailed descriptions. These descriptions enable administrators to comprehend each recipe's functionality and assist team members in extending your recipes in the future.
Docs Copilot generates initial recipe descriptions. This allows you to concentrate more on delivery and less on documentation.
#
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have
Copilot
enabled for your workspace. Enabling Copilots requires an
Admin
system role. If you are not assigned this role, contact your workspace administrator to enable this feature. For more information, refer to our
Copilots
documentation.
PERMISSIONS
Copilots do not have granular permission settings. When you enable it in your workspace, all collaborators within your workspace can access it, regardless of their role.

How it works
Docs Copilot generates a description by receiving information about your recipe, excluding job data. Specifically, Docs Copilot uses the recipe steps, which are the individual actions and triggers that make up your recipe, the input fields where data is entered or mapped, and the applications integrated within your recipe. If your recipe calls other recipes, Docs Copilot also gathers information about those linked recipes to provide a more accurate generation.
You can improve the recipe descriptions that Docs Copilot generates by providing relevant names for all custom actions or HTTP actions in your recipe.
