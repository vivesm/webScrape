Steps
#
Repeat for each loop
A
Repeat for each
loop executes actions inside a block of steps for each item in a given list. The actions you select to repeat must use data output from the Repeat for each loop's datatree to ensure that every item in the list is processed. Actions nested under a Repeat for each block are carried out for all items in the list.
For example, a
Repeat for each
block allows you to create a loop that processes each item in a list of invoice line items.
Repeat for each
is a type of
Repeat control statement
.
To insert a Repeat for each loop into a recipe, click the
+
(plus) button in the recipe editor to add a new step and select
Repeat for each
.
Select Repeat for each
Workato adds a block of steps to the recipe where you can configure the app and action to take for each item in a list.

Example: Repeat for each loop
The following example demonstrates how to use the Repeat for each loop to sync Salesforce accounts using the batch trigger to Zendesk as organizations.
Use the Repeat for each loop to iterate through a list of Salesforce accounts.
Example recipe
(opens new window)
In this example, the trigger returns a list of Salesforce accounts. Since Zendesk does not support batch actions, each Salesforce account must be added one at a time from Salesforce to Zendesk.
The list datapill must be passed into the Repeat for each block. When the input list field is selected, only list type datapills are usable in the datatree, as shown in the following image. List datapills can be identified through their stack icon.

CLEAR STEP OUTPUT
When using a
Repeat for each
loop, set
Clear step output
to
Yes
to process data from each iteration independently. This setting is crucial when using
IF
conditions within the loop because it prevents previous iterations from affecting the current one.
Refer to the
List management documentation
for more information.
Datapills from the Repeat for each output datatree must be mapped to ensure that values from each list item are used when the action is repeated. For example, if the trigger fetches two Salesforce accounts, using datapills from the Repeat for each datatree ensures that the
Create organization
action creates a Zendesk organization with the data from the first Salesforce account on its first iteration, then with the data from the second Salesforce account on its second iteration.
Use datapills from the Repeat for each block's datatree. This ensures values from the list being iterated through are used.
Example recipe

The following image displays the mapping from the Repeat for each datatree.

#
Repeat for each in batches
Occasionally, the rate at which an upstream app or system transmits the data is faster than the rate at which a downstream app or system can receive it. You can use the
Repeat for each in batches
feature to process data by configuring the batch size. Large data sets are automatically parsed into smaller batches for transfer. Each item in the data set is only processed once.
For example, you can use the Repeat for each in batches feature to
create a batch of Salesforce leads
from a list of leads in a CSV.
