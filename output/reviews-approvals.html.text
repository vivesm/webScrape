Review and approve deployments
PRIVATE BETA
This feature is in private beta. Private beta features are available in production but only to selected customers. Customers must opt in and be accepted into the beta.
During the private beta, Workato may update its functionality or change its availability without prior notice.
Deploying recipes across environments (Development, Test, and Production) can lead to errors, operational risks, and compliance issues. The deployment review and approval workflow solves these challenges by ensuring accuracy, governance, and compliance through a structured process.
This workflow is designed for customers using multiple environments. It gives you control over recipe deployments between environments. Regardless of your CI/CD process, this workflow streamlines deployments, improves collaboration, and enforces compliance.
#
Key features
The deployment review and approval workflow offers several features to enhance your deployment process:
Streamlined deployment process
Reduces manual steps and simplifies recipe transitions between environments, making deployments more efficient.
Improved collaboration
Allows you to review, comment on, and approve deployments, promoting better teamwork and communication.
Compliance and governance
Enforces structured approval processes and maintains detailed audit trails for all deployments, ensuring compliance with governance policies.
Risk reduction
Identifies potential issues early in the review process, reducing errors and reducing operational risks.
Enhanced transparency
Gain clear visibility into deployment history and status at every stage, allowing you to track and monitor changes.
#
Enable deployment reviews and approvals
Admin users or users with the appropriate
workspace settings
(WS) permissions can enable the review and approval workflow. This setting controls whether all deployments must go through a structured review and approval process. After enabling the workflow, you can configure collaborator roles and permissions to determine who can review, approve, and deploy.
Complete the following steps to enable deployment reviews and approvals:
1
Sign in to your Workato account. The Orchestrate platform displays by default.
2
Go to
Workspace admin > Settings > Workspace > Deployments
.
Go to the
Deployments
settings
3
Enable the
Require review and approval
toggle. This setting controls whether deployments must go through the review and approval process:
OFF
: Deployments follow the default process without requiring reviews or approvals.
ON
: Deployments must be reviewed and approved before deployment.
4
Click
Save
to apply your changes. The workflow is now enabled for the workspace.
#
Configure permissions
After enabling the review and approval workflow, ensure that users have the necessary permissions to manage reviews and approvals. Users with
deploy permissions
automatically receive
review permissions
, but users with only
review permissions
cannot deploy.
#
Key permissions
Permissions define the actions you can perform within the review and approval workflow. You can assign these permissions in the
Workspace admin > Collaborators > Collaborator roles
settings. Refer to the
Collaborator privileges
documentation for more details.
The following are the key permissions for managing reviews and approvals:
Create deployments
Users with project and folder view access can submit deployments for review in both source and target environments when the
Require review and approval
toggle is enabled. This action does not require deploy permissions.
Review permissions
Review permissions allow you to review and approve deployments. Users must have access to both the source and target environments. Deployment permissions are required to perform the actual deployment.
Deployment permissions
Deploy permissions allow you to deploy and review deployments. Users need access to both the source and target environments to perform these tasks.
#
Role-based permission configurations
Each role in the workspace is assigned specific permissions. The following outlines how permissions are configured for system roles and custom roles:
Admins and analysts
These roles have deploy permissions by default. Deploy permissions also allow users to review and approve deployments.
Custom roles
You can assign custom roles deploy permissions, which include review permissions, or assign review permissions alone based on their responsibilities in the workflow. Ensure these permissions are granted in both the source and target environments.
#
Deployment review process
The deployment review process consists of two main roles: authors and reviewers. Each role has specific capabilities in managing and reviewing deployments to ensure successful transitions between environments.
The following tabs outline the specific capabilities for each role:
As an author, you are responsible for selecting assets, configuring the deployment, and choosing reviewers. After you submit a deployment for review, you can edit the reviewers if needed. You can also add comments on specific assets within the deployment to provide context or highlight important details for reviewers.
For detailed steps, refer to the
Submit deployments for review
section.
As a reviewer, you can review deployments, approve or reject them, and optionally re-open reviews. You can also leave comments during the approval or rejection process for context.
For detailed steps, refer to the
Review deployments
section.
#
Submit deployments for review
The deployment approval process ensures that all deployments are reviewed before moving to the next environment. Before you submit a deployment for review, make sure you have the
required permissions
to create and manage deployments.
#

#
Best practices for reviewing and deploying
To prevent conflicts and unintended overwrites, review and deploy deployments in the order they were submitted. This ensures that newer assets are not overwritten by older versions.
When multiple deployments are pending review or deployment, the most recent ones typically contain the latest updates. Deploying older deployments after newer ones can overwrite these updates, disrupting workflows or causing issues.
Reviewing and deploying in the order deployments were created allows you to:
Compare older and newer deployments to determine if an older deployment should be rejected in favor of a more recent one.
Keep the target environment up to date by deploying the latest assets and updates.
#
How to manage multiple deployments
Use the following practices when managing multiple deployments:
Prioritize reviews
: Identify pending deployments and review them in the order they were created.
Reject or proceed
: Reject unnecessary older deployments to prevent conflicts with newer ones.
Deploy in order
: Deploy sequentially to ensure the target environment receives updates correctly.
While sequential reviews and deployments are recommended, clients may sometimes review or deploy out of order. In these cases, reviewers should check for dependencies and assess potential conflicts.
#
Re-open a review
You can re-open reviews for further adjustments:
Approved
deployments can be re-opened by the reviewer, the author, or other collaborators with project view access.
Rejected
deployments can only be re-opened by the original reviewer who rejected the deployment.
Re-open review
#
Multi-reviewer process
When a deployment is assigned to multiple reviewers, only one review is required to finalize the decision. This can result in either an approval or rejection:
Approval
: If a reviewer approves the deployment, it is considered approved. Further reviews from other assigned reviewers are no longer required.
Rejection
: If a reviewer rejects the deployment, it is considered rejected and cannot be deployed.
A deployment can be re-opened in the following scenarios:
Any reviewer or collaborator with project view access can re-open an approved deployment if they disagree with the approval. This changes the deployment status to
Pending review
, allowing them to approve or reject it.
Only the original reviewer who rejected the deployment can reopen it. This ensures that no one can override the rejection without consulting the original reviewer.
#
Add asset-level comments
Asset-level comments allow you to provide detailed feedback on individual components within a deployment when specific assets require extra attention or clarification after the main review is complete.
Complete the following steps to add an asset-level comment:
1
Go to the
Deployments
tab and select the deployment under review.
2
Click the
Add comment
icon next to the asset you plan to comment on.
Add comment
3
Type your comment in the dialog and click
Save
.
Add comment
Asset-level comments are threaded, allowing you to have ongoing discussions around specific updates.
Comment thread
#
