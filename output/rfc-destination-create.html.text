#
Create an RFC Destination for Workato in SAP
REQUIRED STEPS
Setting up the RFC destination with a
Program ID
is a mandatory step until OPA v24.3.
Effective OPA v25, program ID is an optional field. (Leave it blank in the connection page if you only intend to use RFC/BAPI)
In SAP, use Transaction
SM59
to create a new RFC Destination of type
TCP/IP
(type T).
1
Select the
TCP/IP Connection
folder and click the
create
button.
RFC DESTINATION NAME
Use the RFC Destination name in accordance to the SAP system landscape. For example: the Development, Test, and Production environments can be
WORKATODEV
,
WORKATOTST
, and
WORKATOPRD
respectively.
2
In the
Technical Settings
tab, select the
Registered Server Program
option.
3
Enter
WORKATODEV
,
WORKATOTST
, or
WORKATOPRD
as the program ID, according to the SAP system landscape. These values are case-sensitive.
PROGRAM ID
There can be only one registration with a combination of
SAP Gateway host
+
SAP Gateway service
+
Program ID
active at one time. We recommend that you use a unique program ID to establish multiple connections from Workato pointing to different clients within the same SAP system.
4
Proceed to the
MDMP & Unicode
or
Unicode
tab. Set the communication type to
Unicode
.
5
Click
Save
. Your newly-created RFC destination should appear.
