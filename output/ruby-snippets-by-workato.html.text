Ruby snippets by Workato
Ruby is a popular language for web development. The
Ruby snippets by Workato
connector enables you to write custom Ruby code and insert it into your recipe to execute a custom action. This allows you to use Ruby to perform actions such as invoking external services.
ALLOWLISTED RUBY METHODS ONLY
Only allowlisted Ruby methods can be added to your recipe. Refer to
Available Ruby methods
for more information.
No connection set up is required to use the
Ruby snippets by Workato
connector.

#
Required sections
Section
Description
Name
Provide a descriptive name that indicates the purpose of the action. For example,
Get account details
.
Input
Use this section to pass data into your Ruby code.
Output schema
Use this section to define the data structure that your Ruby code outputs.
Code
Use this section to add the Ruby code you plan to execute. This code can use the data passed in the
Input
section and must return a hash that matches the structure defined in the
Output schema
section.
#
Limitations
The following limitations apply when using the Ruby snippets by Workato connector:
Scripts cannot exceed
1MB
. Larger scripts may cause memory issues.
Code snippets have a total memory limit of
256MB
, including libraries, temporary memory, and inputs.
Actions terminate if they run for more than
30 seconds
.
User-provided libraries are not supported.
#
Input
The
Input
section in your Ruby snippet allows you to pass data into the Ruby code. This can be data from a previous step in the recipe or any other data you plan to use within your Ruby code. You can access the data in the
Input
section using the
input
keyword in your Ruby code.
Input section
You must define the input fields you plan to use in your action:
1
Navigate to the
Input
section.
2
Click
Add field
.
3
Add a
Label
to your input.
Add new field
4
Use the
Data type
drop-down menu to select the data type you plan to use, such as string or boolean.
5
Optional. Enter a description or provide additional context to help users in the
Hint
field.
6
Click
Add field
to add the input field to your action.
7
Repeat these steps for all input fields you plan to pass to your Ruby code.
#
Output schema
The output schema defines the data structure that your Ruby code outputs. This is useful if you plan to use the output of the Ruby code in subsequent recipe steps.
You must define the output schema for the code when you use
Ruby snippets by Workato
to execute an action. The output schema builds the output datatree, allowing you to use the data returned from the Ruby function in subsequent recipe actions.
Output schema
You can configure the output schema by
using sample JSON
or by
manually defining output fields
.
#
Manually define output fields
Complete the following steps to manually add fields to your output schema:
1
Navigate to the
Output schema
section.
2
Click
Add fields manually
.
Manually define your output schema
3
Enter a
Name
for your field.
4
Optional. Add a
Label
to your input.
5
Use the
Data type
drop-down menu to select the data type you plan to use, such as string or boolean.
6
Use the
Optional
drop-down menu to select whether the field is optional or required.
7
Optional. Use the
Nest under
drop-down menu to select where to nest the field.
8
Optional. Enter a description or provide additional context to help users in the
Hint
field.
9
Click
Add field
to add this field to your output schema.
10
Repeat these steps for all fields you plan to pass to your Ruby code.
#
Use sample JSON
Complete the following steps to configure your output schema with sample JSON:
1
Click the
Use JSON
button to open the schema generation wizard.
Define your output schema with sample JSON
2
Paste the JSON sample you plan to use in the window and click
Next
.
3
Review the JSON sample and then click
Generate schema
. The output datatree appears in the
Output
fields.
#
Code
The
Code
field is where you write the Ruby code that your recipe executes. This code can use the data from the
Input
field and must return a hash that matches the structure defined in the
Output schema
field. The keys in the returned hash must match the field names in the
Output schema
, and the corresponding values contain the data for those fields.
Add your Ruby code
#
Error stacktrace
When the "Execute Ruby code" action fails due to an error inside your code, Workato displays the relevant error stacktrace to help you debug your code.
Sample error stacktrace
#
Logging
To help with development and debugging, Workato supports logging intermediate values using
puts
statements. Each
puts
statement is displayed as a new line. Note that Workato only displays
puts
statements as log if a return value exists at the end of the Ruby script.
For example, the following code:
z
=
2
+
1
puts
"The result of the computation is:"
puts z
{
result
:
z
}
Yields the following output:
