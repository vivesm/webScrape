#
Working with SOQL in Salesforce
Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)
is used to search your Salesforce data for specific records. SOQL is similar to the
SELECT
statement in the widely used Structured Query Language (SQL) but is designed specifically for Salesforce data.
The following query shows the basic syntax of a SOQL query:
SELECT
(list of fields)
FROM
(an object)
WHERE
(filter statements and optional sorting)
For a list of standard fields for major Salesforce objects, see
Salesforce Fields Reference
(opens new window)
.
#
Inputting SOQL WHERE Conditions (Syntax)
The SOQL
WHERE
clause follows field expression syntax. A
fieldExpression
is defined as
<fieldName> <comparisonOperator> <value>
. The following sections show examples of valid SOQL
WHERE
queries.
#
Comparison operators
The following list contains all SOQL comparison operators:
=
!=
<
<=
>
>=
LIKE
IN
NOT IN
INCLUDES
EXCLUDES
The following example uses
fieldExpression
syntax with a valid SOQL comparison operator:
Example of using fieldExpression syntax with a comparison operator
For detailed information on how to use each comparison operator, see
Comparison Operators
(opens new window)
.
#
Logical operators
Multiple field expressions can be joined using logical operators. These include:
AND
,
OR
, and
NOT
. The following list contains basic syntax for each operator:
fieldExpressionX AND fieldExpressionY
fieldExpressionX OR fieldExpressionY
NOT fieldExpressionX
The following example uses two
fieldExpressions
joined by a logical operator:
Example of joining two fieldExpressions using a logical operator
For more information on logical operators, see
Logical Operators
(opens new window)
.
#
Other SOQL clauses
LIMIT
: Limits the number of results returned in the search.
OFFSET
: Skips a specified number of rows before returning results.
The maximum value for both clauses is 2,000. Requesting an offset greater than 2,000 results in a
NUMBER_OUTSIDE_VALID_RANGE
error.
#
Date formats and date literals
You must use formula mode to query a date or dateTime field. Formula mode converts your timestamp to the ISO8601 format expected in SOQL.
To filter on date fields in a query, you must use Date only format. The syntax for this is
YYYY-MM-DD
.
To filter on dateTime fields in a query, you must use a format including date, time, and time zone offset. There are three possible dateTime formats:
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss-hh:mm
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
FORMAT FOR DATE AND DATETIME VALUES
Single quotes around date or dateTime values are not required. For date fields, add
.to_date
at the end of your date formula to convert your date or timestamp to the correct format.
The following two examples demonstrate how to use
.to_date
in SOQL queries.
Example of using .to_date in a query
Example of using .to_date in a query
For dateTime fields, the
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
format is the preferred format to use in queries. After using the formula to get your desired timestamp, such as
now
or
2.weeks.ago.beginning_of_day
, add
.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")
to the end of the query.
Example of using .strftime in a query
For more information on date formats and date literals, see
Date Formats and Date Literals

#
Triggers and actions that use SOQL
#
Querying with a WHERE clause
Use one of the following triggers or actions to set up a SOQL query where SOQL input is automatically configured using the fields you provide in the Workato UI.
To quickly setup a SOQL query with the input configured using fields available in the Workato UI, use one of the triggers or actions below:
Triggers
Scheduled record search using SOQL query
WHERE
clause
Actions
Search records in bulk using SOQL query (API 1.0)
Search records using SOQL query
WHERE
clause
When using triggers or actions that require a
WHERE
clause, the recipe automatically handles the
SELECT FROM
portion of your query. The recipe uses the object you chose in the
Fields to retrieve
picklist to
SELECT
all fields
FROM
the object.
You can also specify values for the
LIMIT
and
OFFSET
fields, if available. The
LIMIT
and
OFFSET
fields are not supported in bulk actions.
#
Querying with a full SOQL query
To use a full SOQL query in Workato, use one of the triggers or actions below:
Triggers
Scheduled record search using SOQL query
Actions
Search records in bulk using SOQL query (API 2.0)
Search for records using SOQL query
#
Scheduled records search using SOQL query
The following steps demonstrate how to use the
Scheduled records search using SOQL query
trigger:
1
Enter your full SOQL query in the
SOQL Query
field. You must select
ID
using your
SELECT
statement for this trigger to work.
Example of valid query in scheduled records search
2
Select a schedule and timezone for when the query runs using the
Schedule
and
Time zone
drop-downs.
3
Select a time for when the query runs using the
Hour
,
Minute
, and
Day of month
fields.
4
Optional. Select which days of the week the query runs on using the drop-downs for each day of the week. Selecting
Yes
for a specific day of the week allows the query to run that day.
5
Enter a
Batch size
. The
Batch size
determines the maximum number of records returned every time the recipe is triggered.
6
Select
Use SOQL
in the
Output schema
section. Use the same SOQL that you entered in the
SOQL Query
field in the
Provide SOQL Query
field.
7
Proceed to the
Review data
stage of the
Output schema
section and select
Generate schema
to generate the output schema.
In subsequent recipe steps, the SOQL query output is accessible in the data tree.
SELECT CLAUSE IN SOQL
SOQL queries do not support the
SELECT *
operation often used in SQL queries. You must specify specific fields to retrieve in the SELECT clause.
#
Using a full SOQL query in an action
The following example shows a SOQL query for the
Search records in bulk using SOQL query (API 2.0)
or
Search for records using SOQL query
actions.
Example SOQL query for actions
To generate the output schema, select
Use SOQL
. Use the same SOQL that you entered in the
SOQL Query
field in the
Provide SOQL Query
field.
In the
Review data
stage of the
Output schema
section, the query runs and returns sample rows. Select
Generate schema
to generate the output schema.
Example of generating schema
In subsequent recipe steps, the SOQL query output is accessible in the data tree.
MAXIMUM LENGTH OF SOQL QUERY
The maximum length of a SOQL query is 16,000 characters.
