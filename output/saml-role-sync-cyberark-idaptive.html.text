Sync roles with SAML
#
CyberArk Identity SAML role sync configuration
Integrate Workato with CyberArk Identity to manage SAML role synchronization and ensure that your users' roles are updated when they log in through SAML SSO.
Set up role sync for standard Workato environments: DEV (default), PROD, and TEST, as we recommend this for consistent role management.
#
Prerequisites
1
Ensure that you have successfully configured the SAML SSO within your CyberArk Identity platform. For guidance, go to the
CyberArk Identity SAML Documentation
(opens new window)
.
2
Ensure that you enabled
just-in-time provisioning
in Workato.
3
Ensure that you use
SAML SSO enforcement
for your team or organization.
4
Ensure that you enabled
role syncing
in Workato.

: This attribute maps to the DEV environment.
workato_role_test
: This attribute maps to the TEST environment.
workato_role_prod
: This attribute maps to the PROD environment.
6
Select the attribute type as
Text
from the drop-down menu. Repeat this for each attribute.
7
Ensure the
User Editable
box is unchecked, unless you intend for users to modify this attribute from their portal.
8
Click
Add
to save each attribute.
9
Configure the values for each user based on the roles you plan to assign within each Workato environment.
