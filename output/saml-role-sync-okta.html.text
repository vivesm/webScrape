Sync roles with SAML
#
Okta SAML role sync configuration
When using Okta as your identity provider, you can sync role configurations both for users and for groups.
Here, we configure role sync for basic Workato environments: DEV (default), PROD, and TEST.
#
Prerequisites
Configure the SAML SSO for your Okta tenant.
Enable just-in-time provisioning in the Workato UI.
Enforce SAML SSO for your team or organization.
#
Add custom Workato Role attributes to the Workato user profile in Okta
1
In Okta, navigate to
Directory >> Profile Editor >> Workato App >> Create a new user attribute
.
2
Add a new
workato_role
attribute to the Workato user profile.
3
Specify the fields of the
workato_role
interface:
Workato role definition in Okta
Display name
The name of the new role; use
workato_role
.
Description
An optional description for the role
Enum
Select "Define enumerated list of values".
Attribute members
Add the following
Display name
and
Value
pairs. You can also add Workato system roles and custom-defined roles here.
Click
+ Add Another
to add more entries to the list, or click the delete icon on an existing entry to remove it. Note that values are case-sensitive.
In this example, we are adding a custom role _DevOps_Admin_. You may use additional entries to specify all custom Workato roles in your system.

.
4
Click
Save Attribute
.
Repeat these steps for all the environments you use in Workato. Be sure to follow the
environment naming conventions
that we specify.
#
Configure environment-specific Workato roles in Okta
If you have the Lifecycle Management feature enabled in your Workato instance, you have an option of six (6) new configurable role attributes, depending on your environment and business requirements.
Specify multiple
Environments
by name, with their corresponding
SAML Attribute
.
Dev (main)
workato_role
Test
workato_role_test
Prod
workato_role_prod
Sandbox
workato_role_sandbox
UAT
workato_role_UAT
Stage
workato_role_stage
Pre-prod
workato_role_preprod
#
Configure SAML attribute statements
To include
workato_role
attribute values each time a users signs into Workato through SAML Single Sign On, you must configure the SAML attribute statements.
1
In Okta, navigate to
Application >> Workato >> General >> SAML Settings >> Edit >> Next >> Configure SAML >> Attribute Statement
.
2
Set the values to
appuser.workato_role
, as demonstrated in this interface:
Attribute Statements for workato_role in Okta
Be sure to use the following
Name
and
Value
pairs. Note that the
Name format
field is optional.
workato_role
appuser.workato_role
workato_role_test
appuser.workato_role_test
workato_role_prod
appuser.workato_role_prod
#
Assign the application to a user
Follow these steps to assign the Workato application to an individual user:
1
In Okta, navigate to
Directory >> Users >> Select User >> Assign Application >> Workato
.
2
Assign the application to the user
Select the Workato roles to assign to the user:
User Name
This is the user's email. It appears in the interface by default.
workato_role_prod
Assign the
workato_role_prod
from the list. We specified these options earlier: Workato Admin, Workato Analyst, Workato Operator, or DevOps_Admin. Note that this role is for the PROD environment.
workato_role
Specify the
workato_role
from the list. Note that this role is for the DEV (default) environment.
workato_role_test
Specify the
workato_role_test
from the list. Note that this role is for the TEST environment.
3
Click
Save
.
#
Update the user role
To update a user's role, edit the user’s current role value by making a new selection from the
workato_role
list. Then click
Save
.
Change the user's role
For example, you can change the
workato_role_prod
value for the user
dave.lee
from
Workato Admin
to a custom
DevOps_Admin
role.
Undefined roles
If you change a role value of an
existing
user to a value not defined in Workato, the user retains their existing role.
If using JIT provisioning for a
new
user, an undefined role value results in the user getting the default
Operator
role.
#
Assign the application to a group
Organizations that manage role assignments through groups can assign Workato roles based on the user’s group membership. Users who are members of multiple groups get role assignment based on group priority. See the
Assign attribute group priority
(opens new window)
article in the Okta help center.
1
Create a new group for managing users. You may already have a group for this purpose; use that one.
In our example, we are using the group
DevOps_Admin
.
2
In Okta, navigate to
Directory >> Groups >> select Group >> Applications >> Assign >> select Workato
.
During assignment, the system prompts you to specify the
workato_role
attribute and other environment-specific attributes.
Here, for all members of
Workato_DevOps_Admins
group to have the custom
DevOps_Admin
role, we assign the application for roles across the environments:
workato_role_prod
,
workato_role
, and
workato_role_test
.
Assign role to group
This assigns all members of the group to the
DevOps_Admin
role, in all three (3) environments.
3
Add users to the new (or the existing) group.
4
To change from user-level role management to group-level role management, you must convert existing user assignments to group assignments.
Navigate to the
Applications >> Workato >> Assignments
and select
Convert Assignments
s.
5
Search for the user by name, and check the user assignment to verify that they are now managed by a group.
6
If the user is not managed by a group, and they are eligible for conversion to a group assignment, click
Convert selected
.
Here, our user
[email protected]
can be managed by
Workato_DevOps_Admin
group.
Converting individual user assignments to group assignments
7
Alternatively, you can
Convert all assignments
.
8
To confirm that the user has the correct group assignments, check the
Edit User Assignment
interface.
Verifying app assignment management through Groups
#
Remove environment access
To remove access to a specific environment that you specified earlier, as we did in the section
Set-up environment-specific Workato user role sync
, change the user's role for any environment attribute to “NoAccess”.
For example, you can restrict access to the production environment by setting the
workato_role_prod
attribute to
NoAccess
.
#
Verify role changes
If your organization uses Workato's Activity Audit Logs feature, you can verify the automatic role sync when the user logs in through SAML SSO.
Role changes triggered by SAML assertions appear under the
Source
attribute, with the value
saml_auto_sync
.
Manual role changes made in Workato UI appear have the value
user
.
You can also see the
New Role
and
Previous Role
values.
