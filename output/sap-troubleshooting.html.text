SAP Troubleshooting guide
You may encounter the following issues while setting up the SAP connector. If you don't find your issue listed here, check the
agent.log
file, or contact
Workato Support
(opens new window)
.
#
Enable debug logging
If you are experiencing issues when trying to connect to SAP RFC, we recommend you enable debug logging in your
config.yml
file as the first step. This enables you to see the errors your system encounters.

Example:
logging
:
workato.sap.adapter
:
DEBUG
This guide is organized into
common issues
and
error messages

#
Common issues
#
Agent does not start
The file displays:
JCo initialization failed with java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\Program Files\Workato Agent PROD\lib_ext\sapjco3.dll: Can't find dependent libraries"
On Windows platforms, JCo 3.1 requires you to install the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015-2022 C/C++ runtime libraries on your agent server. If these libraries are not present, you must download and install the latest
Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable Package
from the
Microsoft knowledge base article
(opens new window)
. Select the package that corresponds to your locale and JVM bit-width (x64 for 64-bit operating systems or x86 for 32-bit operating systems).

My OPA raises an error when attempting to connect to SAP.
Check the logs of your OPA to know more. Learn how to
enable debug logging
.
#
I don't see the required IDocs in the drop-down list in Workato.
You must
configure the required IDoc in your SAP system
before Workato can display them in a drop-down list.
By default, the list of IDocs in Workato updates once every 24 hours. You can modify this interval during
OPA connection profile setup
by changing the
metadata_refresh_interval
.

#
I am unable to call Workato's API platform through RFC.
You may require additional configuration on your SAP system to enable TLS 1.2 if this hasn't been done already. Incoming web traffic to Workato is required TLS 1.2 encryption to better secure any information.
Determine how to enable TLS 1.2 and establish a connection to Workato here.
#
Error messages
#
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no sapjco3 in java.library.path
You may have downloaded the Java Connector for the wrong operating system. Ensure that you have downloaded and imported the correct SDK.
This error also displays on Mac OS systems if you have not imported the
libsapjco3.dylib
into the
lib_ext
folder.
#
Classpath entry lib/sap-connector-X.X.X.jar not found, skipped.
Mac users must not move the
sap-connector-X.X.X.jar
to the
lib_ext
folder. Doing so causes errors.
#
Registration of tp <Program's name> from host ??? not allowed
There may be a problem with your
reg_info
and
sec_info
files. To resolve this error follow this
SAP note
(opens new window)
.
Additionally, following these steps may resolve the error:
Move or rename the
reginfo
and
secinfo
files.
Confirm the path in OS level with the values of the parameters in RZ11 tcode on the application level:
gw/reg_info
and
gw/sec_info
.
Set the parameter
gw/reg_no_conn_info
value to
0
.
Set the parameter
gw/acl_mode
value to
0
.
Your SAP server (
gwhost
) may not be accessible from the machine where the OPA is installed. To verify, use Terminal / Command Prompt to ping your SAP server's IP and verify that it's accessible.
#
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sap/conn/jco/JCoException
The SAP JCo library is missing or the classpath is not set up properly.
#
Cannot invoke "com.workato.agent.sap.impl.json.IDocTypeBean.getSegMap()" because "selected" is null
This error occurs because you are trying to create a trigger faster than your OPA can fetch metadata from SAP. You must wait up to 90 seconds for your OPA to fetch the metadata from SAP.
