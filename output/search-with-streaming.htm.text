Stream matching records with a helper flow
To use the streaming feature to pass data from a search or list card to a helper flow, perform the following steps:
Select 
Stream Matching Records
 on the action card (for example, the 
List Users with Filter
 action card for the 
Okta
 connector).
After selecting any desired input fields, click 
Save
.
Click 
Choose Flow
 to open the 
Select flow
 dialog. Either select an existing helper flow from a folder, or click 
New Flow
 to create a helper flow.
If you made a new helper flow, click 
Add event
 and select  
Helper Flow
.
In the helper flow, create two input entries: 
Record
 and 
State
. Set the type for both fields to 
Object
.
The helper flow requires the input fields to be named 
Record
 and 
State
.
The 
Record
 object contains the current item that is being sent to the helper flow. You have access to all  properties that are contained in the object. 
The 
State
 object contains any additional inputs that you want the parent flow to send to the helper flow. 
There's no output field on any action card to display streamed records.
Streamed record example
In this simple example, the 
Okta List Users with Filter
 card executes a search for users and  then streams the records to a helper flow. The helper flow pulls the user's 
ID
 and 
Email
 fields and assigns a single manager's email address to the user.
 To get the manager email  to the helper flow, add a field labeled 
Manager Email
 to the 
Streaming
 section of the parent flow. In the field, enter the value to be sent. Then you reference that 
Manager Email
 field in the 
State
 section inside your helper flow.
The following diagram demonstrates the mappings of this specific example. The helper flow cards appear  show the 
Record
 and 
State
 objects and their subsequent mappings to an 
Assign
 card.
Streamed data from the 
Okta
 user record is passed to the helper flow with the following structure:
Copy
{
    "Record": {
        "ID": "00u2unwcxjXHiqTES0g7",
        "Last Name": "Hendrix",
        "Activated": null,
        "First Name": "James",
        "Email": "jimihendrix@example.com",
        "Created": "2021-09-27T22:23:55.000Z",
        "Second Email": null,
        "Raw Output": {
            "id": "00u2unwcxjXHiqTES0g7",
            "status": "ACTIVE",
            "created": "2021-09-27T22:23:55.000Z",
            "activated": null,
            "statusChanged": "2021-09-27T22:25:36.000Z",
            "lastLogin": "2023-11-14T17:51:00.000Z",
            "lastUpdated": "2021-09-27T22:25:36.000Z",
            "passwordChanged": "2021-09-27T22:25:36.000Z",
            "type": {
                "id": "00u2unwcxjXHiqTES0g7"
            }
        }
    },
    "State": {
        "Manager email": "jessiedoe@example.com"
    }
For this user, the resulting 
Assign
 card in the helper flow has the following fields:
ID
: 
00u2unwcxjXHiqTES0g7
Email
: 
jimihendrix@example.com
Manager
: 
jessiedoe@example.com
