API security
APIs are critical interfaces to your business systems, managing data flow and enabling essential functionalities. Securing APIs is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches that compromise sensitive information.
Workato's API management capabilities provide robust tools to secure your API ecosystem:
#
API clients and access profiles
Workato enables you to
create API clients
, which are logical groupings of users, such as members from the same organization. These clients gain access to API collections through
access profiles
. Access profiles enable you to control who can interact with your APIs and which API collections clients can access. You can create access profiles with various authentication method requirements, and specify more granular controls like allowed IP addresses and policy restrictions.
#
Authentication methods
Workato supports several
authentication methods
to safeguard your API interactions:
Auth tokens
for straightforward, token-based authentication.
OAuth 2.0
for a robust authorization framework that allows granular permissions.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
for stateless, secure information exchange.
OpenID Connect
for identity verification based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
You can configure each authentication method within an access profile. This ensures that API clients are authenticated and authorized according to your security policies.
Using Workato's API management tools, you can ensure your APIs are secure and compliant with industry standards.
