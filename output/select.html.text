Snowflake - Select actions
#
Select rows
This action lets you select rows based on certain criteria defined by a
WHERE
condition. Rows from the selected table that match the
WHERE
condition will be returned as the output of this action.
Select rows action
#
Table
First, select a table to work with. This can be done either by selecting a table from the pick list, or toggling the input to text mode and typing the full table name.
#
WHERE condition
Next, provide a
WHERE
condition to filter rows. This condition can be as simple as filtering a single record by its
ID
.
ID
=
123
Alternatively, it can be used to select multiple rows based on values in one or more columns.
STATUS
=
'closed'
and
PRIORITY
=
1
Complex
WHERE
conditions with subqueries can also be used. Refer to the
WHERE condition
guide for more information.
#
Parameters
Used in conjunction with your
WHERE
condition to prevent SQL injection. After declaring named bind variables in your
WHERE
input, assign values to these variables using this input field.

#
Order by
Rows returned from this action can be ordered based on the
Order by
input field. This field is used to change the default ordering of rows from your Snowflake database.
You can also define the direction of order for each column you wish to order by. The following
Order by
statement will order rows by
priority
in ascending order followed by
created_date
in descending order (latest first).
PRIORITY
ASC
,
CREATED_DATE
DESC
#
Limit
This input field determines the maximum number of rows to return. The default limit is 100 and capped at a maximum of 50000 rows for a single
Select rows
action.
#
Offset
This input field gives you the option to fetch only a page of results from the entire results set. For example, to skip the first 100 rows of the selected results set, input
100
to this field. The default is
0
.
#
Select rows using custom SQL
This action lets you select rows based on a custom SQL query. Rows that are returned from the query will be returned as the output of this action.
Select rows using custom SQL action
#
SQL
Provide the SQL query to be executed to select rows. The query here will be used to generate the output datatree. To do this, the SQL will be executed once when you provide it. You can map datapills here to execute dynamically changing SQL statements. Remember to wrap datapills in quotes (
''
).
Avoid using limit clauses like
LIMIT
in your SQL. This is because the limit to the number of rows returned in the query is based on the value defined in the
Limit
input field
. Adding your own limit clause will cause the action to fail.
#
Limit
This input field determines the maximum number of rows to return. The default limit is 100 and capped at a maximum of 50000 rows for a single
Select rows using custom SQL
action.
If this field is left blank,
LIMIT 100
will be used.
