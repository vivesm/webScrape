Username/Password (Basic authentication)
OAuth 2.0 (Authorization code grant)
Password grant
#
Username/Password
Select
Username/Password
authentication type to connect to your ServiceNow instance with your login credentials.
Username/Password connection
Field
Description
Connection name

OAuth 2.0
authentication type to connect to your ServiceNow instance without using your login credentials. This authentication type allows you to grant access to Workato by obtaining a token rather than disclosing your login credentials.
Only Istanbul and later versions of ServiceNow support OAuth 2.0 connection with authorization code grant flow. Make sure that your ServiceNow version supports this when selecting this authentication type.

Set up an OAuth 2.0 client
You must have an
admin
role to set up an OAuth 2.0 client.
Complete the following steps to set up an OAuth 2.0 client:
1
Activate the
OAuth 2.0 (com.snc.platform.security.oauth)
plugin. Refer to the ServiceNow documentation for more information on how to
activate OAuth 2.0
(opens new window)
Activate OAuth plugin
2
Create an endpoint for a client application to gain access to your ServiceNow instance. Use
https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback
as the
Redirect URL
. Refer to the ServiceNow documentation for more information on how to
create an endpoint for external clients
(opens new window)
.
OAuth 2.0 client
3
Use the Client ID and Client secret to create a ServiceNow connection in Workato. This triggers an OAuth authorization code grant flow that opens a new browser window requesting authorization.
#
Roles and permissions required to connect
To use the ServiceNow connector, you must establish the connection with a user that has roles with access control to the following tables:
Table
Purpose
Operation
Name
Tables
(opens new window)
(sys_db_object)
Contains a row for each table in your ServiceNow instance. This table is used to generate a list of tables to perform an action or trigger event.
read
sys_db_object
sys_db_object.*
Dictionary entry
(opens new window)
(sys_dictionary)
Contains details for each table and columns in each table in your ServiceNow instance. This table is used to generate input and/or output fields when you select a table to perform and action.
read
sys_dictionary
sys_dictionary.*
Some
Base system roles
(opens new window)
(such as
admin
) include access control to these tables. However, if you plan to grant only the minimum required access control for using the ServiceNow connector, consider
creating a custom role
tailored to these access controls.
In addition to their base system role, the user must have access control to the tables required in the integration use case. For example, to create an integration user that can perform standard ITIL helpdesk actions (open, update, close incidents, problems, changes, configuration management items), you must assign them the
itil
role. To grant access only to specific tables or tables besides those available in the base system roles, we recommend that you
create a custom role
and assign the appropriate access control as needed.
#
Create a custom role
You can create a custom role with sufficient access control for the tables you plan to work with if you don't plan to use a
Base system role
(opens new window)
to connect to Workato.
Complete the following steps to create a custom role:
1
Create a role in your ServiceNow instance and assign it a name that reflects its association with the Workato connector, such as
Workato Integrator
. Refer to the ServiceNow documentation for more information on
creating roles
(opens new window)
.
2
Give your new role the following access control rules to use the ServiceNow connector:
Table
Type
Operation
Name
Tables
record
read
sys_db_object
sys_db_object.*
Dictionary entry
record
read
sys_dictionary
sys_dictionary.*
SECURITY ADMIN ROLE REQUIRED FOR ACCESS CONTROL
Only a user with
security_admin
role can edit or create access control. Confirm your permissions with your ServiceNow administrator. Read more about
Elevated privilege roles
(opens new window)
.
Elevate to privilege role
3
Assign the relevant access control to use the triggers/actions you plan to use in your integration use case. For example, you must have a custom role that includes access control to read and write to the incident table for a workflow that requires triggering closed incident events.

Name

#
Real-time triggers
The ServiceNow connector features a set of real-time triggers for new and updated records in a selected table. This trigger uses the
sys_script
table to send HTTP requests to Workato's webhook gateway when the specified event (new or new and updated records) occurs in your ServiceNow instance.
A record is automatically created in the
sys_script
table that points to a webhook URL unique to your recipe when you start a recipe with one of these triggers. Similarly, the same record in the
sys_script
table is deleted when you stop the recipe.
The account you use to establish the ServiceNow connection must be assigned roles with the following access control rules to enable this feature:
Table
Type
Operation
Name
Business Rules
record
read
sys_script
