Set error handling for cards in flows
You can set values for error handling on most cards in Workflows.
Retries for cards in flows only take place as a result of 
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
 errors. You can't set error handling for other HTTP errors.
Click the 
Other options
 gear icon on a card and select 
Error handling
.
In the 
Retry
 dropdown, select a value for the number of times to re-execute a card if an error occurs. The default is 
0 times
.
In the 
After
 dropdown, select a value for the amount of time that the card waits between retries. The default is 
5 minutes
.
This option is useful if, for example, a card  produces an error because an application is unavailable and  needs to wait so the flow can resume without interruption. 
In the 
Then
 dropdown, select an option for what the card must do if it fails to execute. The options are 
Halt Flow
, 
Return Values
, or 
Run another Flow
.
Halt Flow
: Stop the flow with an error.
Return Values
: Stop the flow with an error, but send a custom message to another flow. You can add fields and enter values, or drag and drop outputs from earlier stages in the flow.
Run another Flow
: Stop the flow with an error, but run a helper flow. If your helper flow accepts inputs, call a flow by clicking 
Choose Flow
 and selecting a helper flow from the 
Select flow
 dialog. The helper flow can get the error details using the 
Error
 output field on the helper flow card. See 
Parent flows and other flow types
.
Exceptions to automatic retries
If a card returns one of the following HTTP status codes, then the error handling doesn't trigger a retry. Generally if the card returns one of these status messages, extra attempts can't change the outcome of the request. See 
HTTP status codes
.
Client errors
400 - Bad Request
401 - Unauthorized
402 - Payment Required
403 - Forbidden
404 - Not Found
405 - Method Not Allowed
409 - Conflict
413 - Payload Too Large
421 - Misdirected Request
422 - Unprocessable Entity
Server errors
500 - Internal Server Error
503 - Service Unavailable
504 - Gateway Timeout
If you need to build a flow where retries must take place after one of these HTTP status codes is returned, see 
If Error
