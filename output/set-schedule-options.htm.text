Set schedule options
When you create a scheduled flow, 
Okta Workflows
 prompts you to provide a schedule. Polling monitors default to checking every five minutes.
To change the flow schedule at any time, click the clock icon at the bottom of a 
Scheduled Flow
 event card.
Frequency
Choose a division of time for scheduling your flow.
Minute
: Choose a specific number of minutes from the dropdown list.
For example, select 
15
 to run the flow every 15 minutes. You can optionally set a time range restriction, such as between 09:00 and 17:00. You can also specify which days of the week the flow is run.
Hour
: Choose a specific number of hours from the dropdown list.
For example, select 
2
 to run the flow every 2 hours. The default is to run 
on the hour

Week

Month
