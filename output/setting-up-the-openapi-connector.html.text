Setting Up The OpenAPI Connector
In this guide, we'll walk you through installing and setting up an OpenAPI connector in your Workato account.
NOTE
Refer to the
Using OpenAPI connector to create custom connectors guide
if you want to fully customize your connector.
#
Requirements
To set up an OpenAPI connection, you'll need:
Privileges in Workato that allow you to create connections.
A Swagger file that
:
Conforms to the OpenAPI v2 or v3
specifications
(opens new window)
Is valid JSON or YAML
Note
: We recommend using the connector with
RESTful APIs
(opens new window)
for the best experience. Refer to the
Limitations section in the OpenAPI overview
for more info.
#
Step 1: Install The Connector
The first step is to install the connector in your Workato account:
1
Open
the connector in the community library
(opens new window)
.
2
Click
Install connector
.
3
Click
Release latest version
.
#
Step 2: Configure The Connection In Workato
Step 2.1: Provide The OpenAPI Document
Step 2.2: Define The Authentication Settings
Step 2.3: Define Server And Testing URLs
Step 2.4: Customize The Interface
#
Step 2.1: Provide The OpenAPI Document
In this step, you'll provide the Swagger file containing the API definition.
How you accomplish this is dependent on whether the file is publicly accessible on the internet:
My file is publicly accessible
If the Swagger file is publicly accessible:
1
Select
Document URL
as the
OpenAPI document source
.
2
In the
Document URL
field, paste the document URL to the file.
Note
: Files are only downloaded and parsed at recipe design time. When recipes are run - or when OpenAPI actions are executed - the file won't be downloaded.
My file is not publicly accessible
If the Swagger file isn't hosted or isn't publicly accessible, you can copy and paste the file into Workato:
1
Select
Download content
as the
OpenAPI document source
.
2
In the
Document content
field, paste the contents of the file.
#
Step 2.2: Define The Authentication Settings
Next, you'll define the authentication method for the connection. Learn more about the supported authentication methods
in the OpenAPI overview guide
.
Select the method you're using from the
Authentication Method
menu.
#
Step 2.3: Define Server And Testing URLs
Next, you'll define the server and testing URLs for the connector:
Server URL
: Enter the URL to the application's target host or service, including the
https://
. This is the base URL for requests sent by the connector. For example:
https://api.example.com
Relative endpoint paths from the
API definition
will be appended to this URL to construct the full endpoint URL.
Test Request URL
: Enter the relative path of an API endpoint that Workato can use to verify the connection. This path will be appended to the
Server URL
to construct a full endpoint URL for testing. For example:
/user/profile
Connections are successful when the API responds with a
2XX
status code.
For example: A
Server URL
of
https://api.example.com
and a
Test Request URL
of
/users/profile
creates a full request URL of:
https://api.example.com/users/profile
#
Step 2.4: Customize The Interface
The OpenAPI connector automatically generates the user interface based on the content of the provided
Swagger file
. The following elements can be customized to improve the user experience:
Object names
Object hints
Field names
Field hints
Links to external documentation
API operation grouping
Fields to ignore
Check out the
Customizing OpenAPI user interfaces guide
for more info and examples.
#
Step 3: Test The Connection
When finished configuring the connection, click
Connect
to save and test the connection.
