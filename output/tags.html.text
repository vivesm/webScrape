Tags for assets
Tags enable you to categorize assets such as recipes, connections, data tables, and pages. This enables you to provide additional context and granular organization across projects. Tags streamline asset management by allowing you to filter and search based on specific attributes.
TAG LIMITATION
Each workspace has a limit of 1000 tags.

View tags
: Any user in the workspace can view tags.
Manage tags
: Admins and users with WS permissions can create, edit, and delete all tags across the workspace.
Create and manage personal tags
: Any user can create, edit, or delete their own tags if the
Restrict tag management
toggle is disabled. If enabled, only admins and users with WS permissions can manage tags.
Apply or remove tags
: Users with asset edit permissions can apply or remove tags on assets they can edit.
Ensure the appropriate permissions are set to allow the necessary users to manage tags effectively.
