Recipe design
After you create your recipe
Test Automation
#
Run test case
After you create a test case, you can use it to test your recipe's functionality.
You can run each test case manually from the list of test cases. To access this list, select a recipe and navigate to the
Test cases
tab.
#
Run priority
Test cases run with the same priority as standard recipes. This means that some test cases run sequentially and some run simultaneously to stay within
recipe concurrency
limits.
#
How Workato runs mocked steps
Input
Workato always evaluates the input values.
Step execution
Workato does not run the step. For example, for the step
Search for tickets in Zendesk
Workato does not send a request to Zendesk.
Step output
The step output is replaced with the mock output you provide for a specific step.
#
How Workato handles data checks
#
When checks run
Step input check
This check occurs before the step runs.
Step output check
This check occurs after the step runs.
Step output field check
This check occurs after the step runs.
#
Check conditions for different data types
Workato always evaluates the data type when it performs a check. Depending on what you plan to check, the available set of conditions for a check varies.
Step input/output object checks
Workato compares JSON objects as objects, not as strings.
Available condition(s):
Equals
Output field checks
Available condition(s):

#
How Workato handles step failure checks
In general, test cases pass successfully in the following scenarios:
The test case run job is successful, and all checks are successful.
The test case run job failed, all checks are successful, and all steps with errors have
negative (step failure) checks
set up for them.
#
Examples
The following example scenarios describe how Workato handles step failure checks under certain conditions:
Example 1
The test case run job failed on a
STOP
step.
The step inside the
monitor
block that failed
DOES NOT
have a negative (
step failure
) check.
The step inside the
monitor
block fails.
Overall result:
The test case fails.
Example 2
The test case run job failed on a
STOP
step.
The step inside the
monitor
block that failed
HAS
a negative (
step failure
) check
The step inside the
monitor
block fails.
Overall result:
The test case passes.
Example 3
The test case run job failed on a
STOP
step.
The step inside the
monitor
block has a
throw error
mock and
DOES NOT
have a negative (
step failure
) check
The step inside the
monitor
block fails.
Overall result:
The test case fails.
Example 4
The test case run job failed on a
STOP
step.
The step inside the
Monitor
block has a
throw error
and
HAS
a negative (
step failure
) check
The step inside the
monitor
block fails.
Overall result:
The test case passes.
#
When checks fail
When a check fails, Workato stops the test case run job and does not complete additional recipe steps.
Recipe error
Because a test case run is a recipe run, it fails if there are problems in the recipe.
Check failed
The test case run fails and the job stops when any check fails.
When checked or mocked steps are deleted from a recipe
The test case run fails immediately.
The job report displays the following error message:
Test case contains an error: Some steps with mocks or checks were deleted from the recipe. Please update the test case or revert the recipe to the version that the test case was built for. Please fix it in the test case editor.
EDITING A STEP
When you edit a recipe step, Workato considers this equivalent to creating a new step and deleting the previous step. Thus, if you make changes to any of the steps in your recipe, Workato treats this as a deleted step and the check fails.
