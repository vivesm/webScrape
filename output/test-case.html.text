What is a test case?
A test case is a set of mock data and checks for specific steps of a particular recipe.
You can create multiple test cases for any recipe you plan to test.
A test case defines:
What steps should use mock (simulated) data and the mock data that should be used.
What step output data must be checked and the expected result of the check.
For each test case, you can add a unique name and provide a description of the purpose of the test case.
List of test cases
Each test case contains the following data columns:
Name
