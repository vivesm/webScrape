API endpoints
#
Testing API endpoints
Workato allows you to test
API endpoints
, whether they are
recipe-based
or
proxy-based
.
#
Test a recipe endpoint
If you want to
test a recipe endpoint
, you must configure the corresponding
API recipe
first.
1
Make sure the endpoint's corresponding API recipe is running. You can do this by
starting the recipe
or
enabling the recipe's test mode
.
2
From the API recipe collection page, open the endpoint you want to test.
3
Recipe-based endpoints must be active before you can test them. If you haven't activated the endpoint yet, select the
Inactive
toggle in the upper right of the page to change it to
Active
.
Activate API recipe endpoint
For more information about activating endpoints, see
Activating or deactivating an endpoint
.
4
Select the
Try it out
button to the right of the
Parameters
section.
Try it out button on an API recipe endpoint
5
Enter any required path, query, or body parameters in the
Parameters
section.
The following screenshot shows a recipe endpoint with its required
username
path parameter filled out:

6
Select
Execute
to send the test request.
The following screenshot of a recipe endpoint shows a test response with a
200
success code:
Successful test response
USING THE EXAMPLE CURL COMMAND
The
Responses
section includes an example curl command you can copy and run in your terminal to test the recipe endpoint. Note that before you run the command in your terminal, you must complete the following steps:
Create an API client.
Create an access profile
to grant the client access to the collection with the recipe endpoint you want to test.
Copy the auth token that was generated when you created the access profile.
Add
-H 'api-token: <your-api-token>'
to the example curl command yourself. For example:
curl
-X
'GET'
\
'https://api.na.workato.com/exampleuser/subscription-api-v1/user/rsloan'
\
-H
'accept: application/json'
\
-H
'api-token: 1234567890abcdefgh'
7
View the
Jobs
tab for the corresponding recipe to see the test job you just executed. Select the job to see more details, as shown in the following screenshot:

#
Test a proxy endpoint
You can
test a proxy endpoint
immediately after you create the collection from an OpenAPI specification because Workato simply forwards the request to the specified target URL.
1
Create an API client
if you don't already have one.
2
Create a new access profile
or edit an existing one to give the API client access to the API proxy collection containing the endpoint you want to test.
3
From the API proxy collection page, open the endpoint you want to test and navigate to the
Test
tab.
4
Select the
Try it out
button in the
Parameters
section:
API proxy endpoint Try it out button
5
Enter any required path, query, or body parameters in the
Parameters
section.
The following screenshot shows a proxy endpoint with its required
orderId
path parameter set to the value
1
:

6
In the
Authentication
box, select the
Edit token
button:
Select the Edit token button
7
Select an authentication method from the
Auth method
picklist and enter the access or auth token for your client in the
Token
field.
8
Select
Set token
to confirm the auth token.
9
Select
Execute
to send the test request.
The following screenshot of a proxy endpoint shows a test response with a
200
success code and a downloadable response body:
Successful test response
USING THE EXAMPLE CURL COMMAND
The
Responses
section includes an example curl command you can copy and run in your terminal. Note that you must add
-H 'API-TOKEN: <your-API-TOKEN>'
to the command yourself. For example:
curl
-X
'GET'
\
'https://api.na.workato.com/exampleuser/store/order/1'
\
-H
'accept: application/json'
\
-H
'api-token: 1234567890abcdefgh'
#
Errors
If the response value is not 2XX, the test results in an error. There can be numerous reasons for an error.
The most common error when performing a test from the same account that owns the API recipe is "Invalid request" (400). This usually indicates that the input parameters were incorrect, not all required parameters were supplied, or contained values that are invalid for the target recipe.
If you are configuring an endpoint, proceed to the next section to activate the endpoint.
