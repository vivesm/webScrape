Example
If you have two output fields - 
first name
 and 
last name
 - from an earlier card in your flow, you can create a single name output using the Concatenate function card:
Add a third text input to the Concatenate function card.
Map 
first name
 from another card to the 
text 1
 input field.
Enter a single space in the 
text 2
 input field.
Map 
last name
 from another card to the 
text 3
 input field.
When the flow runs, the Concatenate card will combine all three input values and the 
output
 field will return a single string that contains 
<first name value><space><last name value>
, such as 
John Smith
