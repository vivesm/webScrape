Regular Expressions 
Unlike the Find function card, Find Pattern supports regular expressions. 
Regular Expression

\d

[1-5]

[aeiou]

a
, 
e
, 
i

o

u
.
hello|test
 Finds 
hello
 or 
test
. Either side of the 
|
 operator is a regular expression.
colou?r
Finds 
color
 or 
colour
. The 
?
 signifies that there can be zero or one of the preceding element.
\d{5}
Finds five consecutive digits. The 
{number}
 signifies a number of consecutive instances of the preceding element.
[^\w]
 Finds any character that is not an alphanumeric character. You can add the negative operator 
^
 before any other pattern. For example:
[^a]
 to find anything other than 
a
.
[^\d{3}]
 to find anything that is not three digits in a row.
Many characters have special meaning in regular expressions, such as 
.
, 
+
, 
*
, and 
\
. To search for any such characters, place 
\
 before the character. For example, 
\.
 - finds a period.
You can combine any of the above patterns and fixed text. For example, 
test\.\d{3}
 finds the word 
test
 followed by a period followed by three consecutive digits.
Example
For simple searches, the Find Pattern function card performs like the 
Find
.
If the 
look in
