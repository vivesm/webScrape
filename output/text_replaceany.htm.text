Replace Patterns
Find and replace multiple text patterns with a single value.
For any find and replace that looks for a single text or pattern, use  
Replace
 instead.
Input
Field
Definition
Type
Required
look in
Text within which a search for a string is performed.
String
TRUE
replace with
String with which input text is replaced or removed (by using a null value).
String
FALSE
all instances
Indicates whether all strings matching the value in 
look for
 are replaced. Default is 
True
.
Boolean
FALSE
case sensitive
Indicates whether all strings matching the string value and case in 
look for
 are replaced. Default is 
True
.
For example, if 
case sensitive
 is set to 
False
, then a value of 
Test
 in 
look for
 would match 
test
, 
TEST
, and 
tEsT
.
Boolean
FALSE
patterns
Unlike the 
Replace
 function card that searches for a single text or pattern, this input section allows you to add multiple texts or patterns for a search. All such patterns are replaced with the same value from the 
replace with
 field. 
 Add a new input to the 
patterns
 section for each additional pattern. The name of each input is ignored.
String
FALSE
Output
Field
Definition
Type
result text
String value after matching string values are replaced.
If no instances of 
look for 
are found, then 
result text
 is the same as the original input value for the 
look in
 field.
String
Regular Expressions 
Each pattern can be simple text to search for or can be a more complex pattern that uses regular expressions.
Regular Expression
Definition
\w
Finds any alphanumeric character (for example, a letter or number).
\s
 Finds any whitespace character (for example, a blank or tab).
\d
Finds any digit.
[1-5]
 Finds a number between 1 and 5.
[aeiou]
 Finds 
a
, 
e
, 
i
, 
o
, or 
u
.
hello|test
 Finds 
hello
 or 
test
. Either side of the 
|
 operator is a regular expression.
colou?r
Finds 
color
 or 
colour
. The 
?
 signifies that there can be zero or one of the preceding element.
\d{5}
Finds five consecutive digits. The 
{number}
 signifies a number of consecutive instances of the preceding element.
[^\w]
 Finds any character that is not an alphanumeric character. You can add the negative operator 
^
 before any other pattern. For example:
[^a]
 to find anything other than 
a
.
[^\d{3}]
 to find anything that is not three digits in a row.
Some characters have special meaning in regular expressions, such as 
.
, 
+
, 
*
, and 
\
. To search for any of those characters, place a 
\
 before the character. For example, 
\.
 finds a period.
Combine any of the above patterns and static text. For example, 
test\.\d{3}
 finds the word 
test
 followed by a period followed by three consecutive digits.
Example
Use this function to strip out a set of characters from a longer string value in the 
look in
 field. To do so, add fields in the 
patterns
 section for each string that needs to be deleted and leave the 
replace with
 field blank.
Also use this function to obscure certain characters in text by replacing them with an asterisk.
