Unique ID
Generate a random universally unique identifier (UUID), sometimes called a globally unique identified (GUID). The identifier consists of 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits, displayed in five groups and separated by hyphens.
Use this function card when you need to assign a unique ID, such as a tracking number for a transaction.
The algorithm to generate the random UUID is RFC 4122 version 4.  This same algorithm is used to assign unique IDs to each flow execution and to each new row in a table.
