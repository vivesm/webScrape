API traffic mirroring
PRIVATE RELEASE
This feature is in private release. Private release features are available in production but only to selected customers. Contact your Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.
API traffic mirroring allows you to mirror API traffic from your API collections to your external security information and event management (SIEM) provider for advanced analysis, including anomaly detection and PII monitoring. Enable this feature to send API request and response payloads, along with metadata, to your SIEM tool.
