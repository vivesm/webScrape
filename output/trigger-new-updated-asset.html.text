Bynder Trigger - New/updated asset in Bynder
Triggers when a new asset is added to the Bynder account or existing asset in the Bynder account is updated. Trigger will pick up new assets created from the time recipe has started. Checks for new assets every 5 minutes.
Bynder allows an asset to be updated by having multiple versions. You can update the original file in Bynder while keeping all the metaproperties, tags and other information the asset is tagged with as well as any attached additional files and manual derivatives.
