Undefined method for nil:NILClass
Troubleshoot undefined method error under 3 min
The
Undefined method for nil:NILClass
occurs when you attempt to use a formula on a blank datapill. This indicates that the datapill was not provided any value at runtime.
Example of Undefined method for nil:NILClass
#
Solution
Since the value of a datapill at runtime is unknown beforehand, Workato recommends building recipes that are responsive to such situations.
Add the
&
safe navigation operator to your formula. For example:
[Datapill]&.capitalize
This operator first checks if the datapill has a valid value. If the datapill is valid, it performs the specified formula. Otherwise, it skips the formula and return
null
. This solution prevents the
Undefined method for nil:NILClass
error from stopping your recipes.

.capitalize
formula

Why does this error occur?
This occurs when the value of the datapill is
null
at runtime. It can happen if your
Get
action returns records with missing fields,
Search
actions that return no results, or a SQL query that returns 0 rows.
In this example recipe, step 3 (Update lead in Marketo) uses a formula on a datapill from a previous step. If the output from step 2 has missing values, the datapill will not contain any value when the recipe runs.
Example of Undefined method for nil:NILClass
Since the
capitalize
formula does not apply to a datapill with no value, the job fails with the following error message:
Error calculating input for field 'company':
Formula received a nil value:
undefined method `capitalize' for nil:NilClass
