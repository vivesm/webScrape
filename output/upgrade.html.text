On-prem agent
#
Upgrading to newer versions
We recommend upgrading your on-prem agent on a regular basis. With every release, we add new features along with improved performance, stability, and security. Refer to the
release notes
(opens new window)
for more information about all the changes.
HOW TO UPGRADE
You have several ways to upgrade your existing on-prem agent:
Upgrade an existing agent with zero downtime
Upgrade an existing agent by stopping and replacing the old one
Upgrade an existing agent older than 2.15.0 and configure connections directly in Workato
PRIVATE KEY
Workato does not have access to your private key file,
cert.key
, in the OPA
conf
folder. Ensure you protect this file from unauthorized access.
#
Upgrade an existing agent with zero downtime
When you are running your agent in the production environment and do not want interruptions, you can upgrade by adding another agent to your on-prem group.
This is a recommended way to upgrade your OPA.
1
Go to your
on-prem agent page
(opens new window)
and open the on-prem group with the agent that you want to upgrade.
2
If your group has more than one agent simply stop or disable the one you want to upgrade. The other agents will continue processing the jobs.
3
If you have only one agent in your on-prem group, add another one following
these steps
(opens new window)
.
4
Afterwards, start your new agent. The new agent should start accepting some of the jobs. You can
check the logs of the new agent to make sure it is working properly.
CONNECT WITH CONFIG.YML
If you are using the
config.yml
file to set up your connections, copy it from your old agent to the new one. This allows agents to connect to the same resources.
AGENT ENCRYPTION
If you use password encryption on your passwords, you must encrypt them again for the new agent. The encryption is based on specific agent keys, which are different for each agent.
5
Stop your old agent. You can do this by stopping the Windows service or by disabling the agent in Workato.
6
The agent that you added in previous steps has now replaced your old on-prem agent. After you confirm that the new agent is working properly, and there are no errors in your running recipes, you can remove or uninstall the old agent. In case of any issues, you can disable the new agent and restart the old one.
#
Upgrade an existing agent by replacing the old one
An existing agent upgrade requires stopping an existing Workato on-prem agent and replacing it with the latest version. Follow the instructions below depending on your operating system.
#
Windows
Open Workato and go to your
on-prem group page
(opens new window)
.
Open your on-prem group and find the agent that you want to upgrade. Check the current agent version and click on
Update to <latest_agent_version>
.
Update on-prem agent to the latest version
The upgrade wizard will open. Check the release notes and follow the steps in the wizard, which are also mentioned below.
On-prem agent upgrade wizard
Verify that the agent is stopped (either terminate
Workato Agent
Windows service or console-based agent)
Uninstall the agent (for example,
Start Menu → Workato → Uninstall
). This should not change the
config.yml
file and the certificate files (
cert.key
,
cert.pem
) in
C:\Program Files\Workato Agent/conf
.
REMAINING FILES AFTER UNINSTALL
Some files may remain in the OPA directory after uninstalling the agent. To avoid potential issues, remove them manually. Retain the
conf
and
lib_ext
folders if you plan to upgrade the agent.
Run the downloaded installer (this will automatically install to the same location)
Run the agent. Depending on the setup, either start
Workato Agent
Windows service or run the agent from the command line.
Make sure your agent is active and verify its version number on the
on-prem agent page
(opens new window)
.
#
Linux DEB package
Upgrade the agent using following command:
%
sudo
apt
upgrade workato-agent
The service should automatically stop, upgrade and restart for systemd-based distributions. If that won't happen you have to do it manually.
NON-US DATA CENTERS
Workato no longer publishes data center-specific OPA versions. Packages with the suffixes
-eu
,
-sg
,
-jp
, and
-au
still function but are no longer supported.
To upgrade a data center-specific agent, uninstall the old package and
install the latest version
of the single package distribution. You can retain the
conf
and
lib_ext
folders.
#
Linux RPM package
Upgrade the agent using following command:
%
sudo
yum upgrade workato-agent.x86_64
The service should automatically stop, upgrade and restart for systemd-based distributions. If that won't happen you have to do it manually.

#
Upgrade an existing agent older than 2.15.0 and configure connections directly in Workato
With on-prem agent
version 2.15.0
, we have introduced a new and easy way of setting up the connections. Instead of using the
config.yml
file you can configure the connection directly in Workato.
