Snowflake - Upsert action
Workato offers both batch and single upsert row actions. This allows you the flexibility to choose the action that you require for your recipe and to fulfill your business needs.
#
Upsert batch of rows
This action allows you to upsert multiple rows in a single action instead of one row at a time. This provides higher throughput when you are moving a large number of records from one app to Snowflake. Depending on the structure of your recipe and volume of data, this action can reduce integration time by a factor of 100.
Upsert batch of rows action
#
Table
Just like with the single row upsert action, you need to select the target table first.
#
Rows source list
Unlike the
Upsert row
action (where we deal with a single row), we are now dealing with a batch of rows. Hence, the next datapill to input is the
source
of the batch of rows to upsert to the table. This can come from any trigger or action that outputs a list datapill.
If you do not map a list datapill to this field, this action will upsert only 1 row and will behave like the
Upsert row
action.
#
Columns
Finally, you will need to map the required fields from the output datatree here to upsert rows with data from preceding trigger or actions. Take note that datapills mapped to each column here should be from the source list datapill you used earlier. Datapills that are mapped outside the source list datapill will not be iterated (mappings like this will become a constant value for all rows).
Similar to the
Upsert row
action, primary key values provided will be used to determine an update or create for each row.
Refer to the
List management
guide for more information about working with batches.
