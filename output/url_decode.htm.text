Decode Query
Decode a URL-encoded query string into a query object.
This function card is the inverse of the 
Encode Query
 function.
Use the 
Parse
 function when you have a full URL that you want to separate into component parts, including the query string. Then, you can drag the 
query
 output from the 
Parse
 function into the 
query
 input of your 
Decode Query
 card.

The

 function card converts this 
query
 text to the following 
output
 object:

"name": "John Doe",
"region": "North America"
}
