Encode Component
This function encodes all special characters of a string into an encoded text string for use in a URL.
This function is the inverse of the 
Decode Component
 function.
If you want to build out a URL where a value is returned from a previous step, then you can use this function to encode that value.
For situations where you have multiple entries to encode, use the  
Encode Query
 function card. That function uses an object to build a single encoded query string.

Delimiters and special characters
When making API requests, it's essential to encode any special characters to ensure that the server interprets them correctly. However, don't encode any delimiters used in the URL. 
Special characters include spaces, punctuation marks, and non-ASCII characters. These characters can cause issues in URLs if you don't properly encode them.
Delimiters are essential parts of the URL structure, so don't encode them. The 
?
 delimiter for query strings is a literal character inside the URL. This delimiter is used so the web server knows where the path ends and where the query string begins.
See 
Special characters and delimiters
.
Example
 If your input is 
Sherlock Holmes: Detective
, then the encoded output is 
Sherlock%20Holmes%3A%20Detective
.
You can then use the  
Format
 function card to build the full URL. Adding the encoded output to 
https://www.example.com/searchcustomers?name=
 results in the full URL: 
https://www.example.com/searchcustomers?name=Sherlock%20Holmes%3A%20Detective
.
