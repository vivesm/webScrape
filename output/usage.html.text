Usage
The
Usage dashboard
provides an overview of your workspace consumption. It enables you to monitor and analyze usage patterns for improved visibility, tracking, and data-driven decision-making. It displays metrics on billable task usage, active On-prem agents (OPAs), high-volume recipes (HVRs), and other key factors across your workspace. These metrics help you manage usage, optimize resource utilization, and plan effectively.
Key features of the dashboard include the following:
Aggregate and detailed views
Analyze billable tasks both in total and by individual asset types.
Time interval visualization
View data over different periods (weekly, monthly, cumulative) and group by specific asset types to detect usage trends and spikes.
