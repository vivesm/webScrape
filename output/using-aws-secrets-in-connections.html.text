AWS Secrets Manager
#
Use AWS Secrets Manager in connections
Video guide: Set up connections safely with AWS Secrets Manager
This guide explains how to use secrets from your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Secrets Manager vault to configure Workato connections.
#
Prerequisites
To complete the steps in this guide, you must have the following prerequisites:
In Workato
:
A successful AWS Secrets Manager
workspace-level
or
project-level
connection.
A
user role
with
Create
and
Edit Connections
privileges.
In Amazon Web Services (AWS)
:
An existing secret in
JSON key/value pair
format. Workato doesn't support plaintext secrets. Refer to the AWS documentation for more information on how to
create a secret
(opens new window)
.
Permissions that allow you to view secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.
#
Retrieve the secret's details from AWS
Complete the following steps to retrieve the secret's details from AWS:
1
Sign in to your AWS Management Console and open the
Secrets Manager console
(opens new window)
.
2
In the navigation pane, click
Secrets
.
3
Click the secret you plan to use in Workato.
4
Copy and store the
Secret name
and
Secret ARN
securely. These values are required to configure the external secret in Workato.
#
Configure a Workato connection
Complete the following steps to configure a connection in Workato using AWS Secrets Manager:
1
Create a new connection or open the configuration page for an existing connection in your Workato account.
2
Click or hover over the input field that requires an external secret, then click
+ Add external secret
.
3
Enter the
Key name
and
Secret ARN
in the
Add external secret
dialog.
Add external secret
4
Click
Done
. The secret appears as a masked datapill in the input field on the connection page.
Select the datapill to edit the secret.
5
Click
Connect
and verify that this connection works.
If you prefer to add the secret with a secret mask, follow this syntax for the secrets used in Workato connection credentials:
{{workato:sm:<key name>:<secret ARN>}}
<key name>
Refers to the specific key name within a secret, not the secret name itself. For example, in a secret named
jira
, there may be a key/value pair where
prod.jira.secret.key
is the key name, and its value is the actual personal access token.
<secret ARN>
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the secret in AWS Secrets Manager. For example:
{{workato:sm:prod.jira.secret.key:arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:137149879143:secret:prod-jira-credentials-FsmeTs}}
In this example,
prod.jira.secret.key
is the key name in a secret named
jira
, and
arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:137149879143:secret:prod-jira-credentials-FsmeTs
is the
secret ARN
.
In the connection's configuration page, paste this entire value into the appropriate field. The following image shows a secret being used as the
Custom Service client secret
value in a Jira connection:
