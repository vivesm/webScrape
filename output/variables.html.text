Variables by Workato
Workato variable is a user-declared
datapill
that contains a data value. These user-declared variables are different from a standard datapill in that your declared variables are mutable - the value of the variable can be changed within a recipe.
The lifetime of a variable is for the duration of a single job (job scope) - there is no persistence, and no mechanism can access this across different jobs.
Workato variables are typed. In order to use variables, you will first have to declare it using the
create variable
action. To update the variable, use
update variables
action.
#
Example
If you want to find a particular entry within a report - the entry with the
largest ARR
.
Create a variable called
ARR
.
Run the
for each
action, and update
ARR
whenever it finds a higher value.
Subsequently, use the
ARR
value to call up that specific entry.
Iterate through the report for highest ARR
