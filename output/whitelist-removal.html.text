#
Removal of Ruby whitelist for SDK
Following the migration of custom connector code execution to
isolated containers
,
Ruby whitelisting
is removed from the connector SDK. This change significantly expands the range of capabilities SDK developers can use within the platform. Developers can now leverage the
full functionality of Ruby 2.7
, including built-in libraries and Ruby gems available in the SDK container.
#
Key capabilities
With the removal of Ruby whitelisting, developers can now access the full functionality of Ruby 2.7, including built-in libraries and Ruby gems available in the SDK container.
Access to Ruby 2.7 standard methods
Developers now have access to the full range of Ruby 2.7 standard methods. Developers can also use Ruby’s
require
method to import built-in libraries, such as JSON, CSV, socket, and others.
Pre-installed Ruby Gems
Developers can now directly use a selection of pre-installed Ruby gems without restrictions:
activesupport
(5.2.8.1)
aws-sigv4
(1.2.4)
charlock_holmes
(0.7.7)
concurrent-ruby
(1.2.3)
gyoku
(1.3.1)
i18n
(0.9.5)
jwt
(2.1.0)
loofah
(2.21.3)
mime-types
(3.5.2)
nokogiri
(1.15.6)
rails-html-sanitizer
(1.4.4)
rest-client
(2.1.0)
ruby_rncryptor
(3.0.2)
TCP sockets
Developers can now leverage TCP sockets for low-level TCP connections.

.
Example use case: Implement MQTP protocol over UDP or WebSocket connections.
Classes and modules
Developers can now define classes and modules, improving code reusability, organization, and maintainability.
Dynamic code execution
Using the
eval
method, developers can now dynamically load and execute code. Code can be generated on the fly based on runtime data and executed immediately.
Multi-threaded and concurrent code
Developers can now write multi-threaded and concurrent code.

Example connector ideas
E-commerce data scraper
A connector that uses
nokogiri
to scrape product data from various e-commerce websites, transforms the data using
gyoku
, and uploads it to a central database for analysis.
Secure API Gateway
A connector that uses
jwt
for secure API authentication and
rest-client
to interact with multiple third-party APIs, aggregating data and providing a unified interface.
Amazon S3 file manager
A connector that uses
aws-sigv4
to securely upload and download files from Amazon S3, with MIME type handling using
mime-types
to ensure correct file processing.
HTML sanitization
A connector that uses
loofah
and
rails-html-sanitizer
to sanitize HTML content, removing potentially harmful elements and ensuring data integrity.
Real-time data processor
A connector that uses
concurrent-ruby
to process multiple data streams in parallel, such as Internet of Things sensor data, performing real-time analysis and actions.
Concurrent processing
A connector that uses
concurrent-ruby
to handle concurrent tasks, improving the performance and responsiveness of connectors.
JWT authentication
A connector that uses the
jwt
gem to create and verify JSON web tokens for secure API authentication.
XML and HTML data handling
A connector that uses
nokogiri
and
gyoku
for parsing, transforming, and generating XML and HTML data. This can be useful for integrating with systems that use XML-based APIs or for web scraping tasks.
