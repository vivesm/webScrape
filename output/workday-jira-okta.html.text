Create your recipe
Complete the following steps to create a recipe that monitors Workday for new employees. When activity is detected, it creates a new user in Jira and a new user in Okta:
USE CASES ARE INTENDED AS EXAMPLES ONLY
This use case serves as an example. Modifications to triggers, actions, or conditional logic may be necessary to adapt this recipe to your workflow.
1
Sign in to Workato.
2
Select the project where you plan to create the recipe.
3
Create connections for Workday, Jira, and Okta:
Create a Workday connection.
#
Before connecting to Workday
Before integrating with Workday using third-party services like Workato, we recommend using an
Integration System User (ISU)
. Using an ISU ensures that all integration operations are logged under a designated user, separate from regular workflow processes. This is essential as changes to a regular worker’s security profile or their termination could disrupt integrations reliant on their account. For enhanced security, limit each ISU to a single integration system, such as Workato.
Additionally, if your integration involves
custom objects
in Workday, you must register a Workday
API client
. This step is required as the Workday REST API requires authentication through an OAuth client setup.
#
Authentication requirements
The Workday connector supports both OAuth 2.0 and basic authentication methods. However, OAuth 2.0 authentication is required for working with the Workday REST API and custom objects. We recommend that you avoid using the deprecated
Hybrid
authentication method.
#
Connection setup using OAuth 2.0 authentication
To configure your Workday connection in Workato using OAuth 2.0 authentication, complete the following steps:
1
Enter a unique
Connection name
to identify your Workday account in Workato.
Label your connection
2
Choose
OAuth 2.0
as the
Authentication type
. This method is required for working with custom objects and for querying data using Workday Query Language (WQL) with the Workday REST API.
3
Select the
Workday web services version
appropriate for your Workday tenant. We recommend choosing the newest version available for access to the latest features and updates.
4
Locate and enter your
Tenant ID
from the URL when logged into Workday. For example, in
https://impl.workday.com/sample_company/d/home.htmld
, the tenant ID is
sample_company
.
5
Provide the
WSDL URL
associated with your Workday services.
6
Enter the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
from your API client settings.
7
Optional. Input your
Refresh token
if you are using an API client for integrations.
8
Enter your
Authorization endpoint
and
Token endpoint
from your API Client settings to complete the OAuth flow.
9
Select the
Workday tenant timezone
that matches your Workday tenant's settings. By default, Workday uses Pacific Standard Time (PST).
10
Optional. Click
Advanced settings
to configure the
Advanced XML payload for multiple ID values
field.
By default, when constructing the XML from your input, Workato wraps each value in fields with multiple values within its own container.
For example:
<
languages
>
<
language
>
english
</
language
>
</
languages
>
<
languages
>
<
language
>
chinese
</
language
>
</
languages
>
If you set the value to
Yes
, Workato unwraps these values, presenting them in a single container:
<
languages
>
<
language
>
english
</
language
>
<
language
>
chinese
</
language
>
</
languages
>
Consider setting this field to
Yes
if you encounter invalid payload errors.

Connection setup using basic authentication

1

Label your connection
2
Select
Basic
as the
Authentication type
. This method uses your Workday username and password for integration.
3
Select the
Workday web services version
appropriate for your Workday tenant. We recommend choosing the newest version available to access the latest features and updates.
4
Locate and enter your
Tenant ID
from the URL when logged into Workday. For example, if your URL is
https://impl.workday.com/sample_company/d/home.htmld
