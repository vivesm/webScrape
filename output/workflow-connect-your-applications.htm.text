Connect your applications
When you build a 
flow
, connections authorize 
Okta
 to interact with your target application. Each application controls access in different ways--some use  API tokens and others use OAuth scopes. Each user has a different access level depending on their permission level in that application.
Authenticate your Okta account
Connect other applications
Authenticate your Okta account
Authenticate your 
Okta
 account before you do anything else in the 
Workflows Console
. You only need to do it once. This task requires you to copy information from your 
Admin Console
 to the 
Workflows Console
, so be sure to keep 
Admin Console
 open. 
In 
Admin Console
, go to 
Applications
Applications
.
Select the 
Okta Workflows
 OAuth
 app, and then open the 
Sign On
 tab. Keep this page open, and continue to step 3.
In the 
Admin Console
, go to 
Workflow
Workflows Console
.
In the 
Workflows Console
, click 
New Connection
.
In the 
Connection Nickname
 field, enter the display name that you want to appear in your connector list.
In the 
Domain
 field, enter your 
Okta
 org's domain, without 
http://
 and 
-admin
, if applicable. For example, if the URL is 
http://organization-admin.okta.com
, your domain is 
organization.okta.com
.
In the 
Admin Console
, copy the client ID from the Okta Workflows OAuth app. Return to the 
Workflows Console
, and paste it in the 
Client ID
 field of the Connection window.
In the 
Admin Console
, copy the client secret from the Okta Workflows OAuth app. Return to the 
Workflows Console
, and paste it in the 
Client Secret
 field of the Connection window.
In 
Workflows Console
, click 
Create
.
Connect other applications
With your 
Okta
 account authenticated, you can now start building Flows to other applications. Connection requirements vary by application, but all require a Connection Nickname so that you can create multiple accounts (for example, admin or end user). 
There are two ways to set up connections:
 On the Settings page in the 
Workflows Console
, click  
New Connection
. Click the icon of the app you want to connect, and enter the required information.  App-specific help is available in this window by clicking 
Need Help?
.
In the 
Workflows Console
, click 
New Flow
. When you add an event or action for an unauthorized app, the card prompts you to connect. Click 
New Connection
, and enter the required information.
After the  connection is authorized, you can add that app to any flow without reentering credentials. When you choose an event or action card, select the connection you want to use and click 
Done
.
If your connection is lost, reauthorize by following the instructions on this page.
