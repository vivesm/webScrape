Parse
Convert an XML string to an object. 
By converting an XML string to an object, you can use many of the built-in functions to process and use the XML values throughout the rest of your flow.
Input
Field
Definition
Type
Required
xml
XML string to  convert into an object.
Text
TRUE
options
attrkey
The string used as the key for the attribute object created for each XML element.
The default is 
$
.
Text
TRUE
charkey
A text string to use as the key to access character content within an XML element. 
This string is applied only if 
explicitCharkey
 is set to 
True
. 
The default is 
_
 (the underscore character).
For example, consider the following output:
Copy
 "ARTIST": [
        "The Men"
      ],
If you set 
charkey
 to 
_
 and 
explicitCharkey
 is 
True
, then this element becomes:
Copy
 "ARTIST": [
        {
          "_": "The Men"
        }
      ],
Text
FALSE
explicitCharkey
Indicates if a 
charkey
 is used.
The default is 
False
.
True/False
FALSE
trim
Indicates if the white space at the beginning and end of a text node should be removed
The default is 
False
.
For example, if set to 
True
, then the text string 
' Surfer  Blood  '
 in the input XML becomes 
'Surfer Blood'
 in the output object.
True/False
FALSE
normalizeTags
Indicates if all tag names should be normalized to lowercase.
The default is 
False
.
For example, if set to 
True
, then the tag 
ARTIST
 in the  input XML becomes 
artist
 in the output object.
True/False
FALSE
normalize
Indicates if any whitespace within a text node should be trimmed. This is similar to 
trim
, but also acts on any whitespace between text elements.
The default is 
False
.
For example, if set to 
True
, then the text string  
'Surfer  Blood  '
 in the input XML becomes 
'Surfer Blood'
 in the output object.
True/False
FALSE
explicitRoot
Indicates if the resulting object should include the root node.
The default is 
False
.
For example, if set to 
True
, the 
example output
  is wrapped within a 
catalog
 object.
True/False
FALSE
Output
Field
Definition
Type
output
The object that's constructed from the input XML text and your selected options.
Object
Example input
This is an XML example of a simple record catalog:
Copy
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<catalog>
    <release id="JNR165.8">
        <artist>Surfer Blood</artist>
        <title>1000 Palms</title>
    </release>
    <release id="OLE 984-7">
        <artist>The Men</artist>
        <title>Singles Going Home Alone #3</title>
    </release>
</catalog>
Example output
The following is the object created from the 
example XML input
 using the default selections on the function card:
Copy
{
  "release": [
    {
      "$": {
        "id": "JNR165.8"
      },
      "artist": [
        "Surfer Blood"
      ],
      "title": [
        "1000 Palms"
      ]
    },
    {
      "$": {
        "id": "OLE 984-7"
      },
      "artist": [
        "The Men"
      ],
      "title": [
        "Singles Going Home Alone #3"
      ]
    }
  ]
