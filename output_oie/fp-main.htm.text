Okta FastPass
Okta FastPass
 is a phishing-resistant, passwordless authenticator. It enables secure access to 
Okta
-protected apps across all supported platforms on managed and unmanaged devices. To use 
Okta FastPass
, users must install the latest version of the 
Okta Verify
 app and create an account on their desktops, laptops, or mobile devices. 
Okta Verify
 with 
Okta FastPass
 support is available for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.
Benefits
Phishing-resistant authentication
You can configure phishing-resistant constraints in your authentication policy rules. When users sign in to apps, 
Okta FastPass
 verifies that the authentication request doesn't come from a malicious site. You can also configure a phishing-resistant authenticator enrollment for your users.
Passwordless authentication
Okta FastPass
 uses public key cryptography to authenticate users. By eliminating the need for passwords, 
Okta FastPass
 provides user-friendly authentication while reducing the risk of security incidents and the IT costs associated with factor enrollment and reset.
Device posture evaluation
For increased security, you can use device assurance policies to configure access to resources based on device attributes such as operating system and screen lock. During authentication, 
Okta FastPass
 collects security signals from 
Okta
 and third-party sources and evaluates the device posture according to the device assurance policy rules. Compliant devices are granted access to resources. On non-compliant devices, users are denied access unless they complete remediation actions.
Consistent user experience
Okta FastPass
 works with OIDC, SAML, and WS-Federation apps protected by 
Okta
. It integrates with built-in device authenticators such as Windows Hello, Touch ID, or Face ID to facilitate biometric authentication. 
Okta FastPass
 is supported on managed and unmanaged devices on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. 
How it works
In the following example, users authenticate with 
Okta FastPass
 without providing a username or password.
The user initiates an authentication request by accessing an 
Okta
-protected app.
The 
Okta
 server issues a unique challenge for the authentication request.
The 
Sign-In Widget
 on the browser or an OS-specific app forwards that challenge to 
Okta Verify
 with 
Okta FastPass
 enabled (installed on the same device).
Okta FastPass
 collects device signals, generates a response, and signs it with the proof of possession private key that was issued during user enrollment.
Okta FastPass
 sends the response to the server.
The 
Okta
 server validates the signature and confirms that the response corresponds to the unique challenge that was issued.
The 
Okta
 policies are evaluated based on the device context collected. If the policy conditions are met, the user is granted access to the app.
