# WebScrape Improvement Plan

## Current Status
- [x] Implement browser pooling to reduce resource usage
- [x] Implement proper error handling for common HTTP errors (403, 429, 503)
- [x] Refactor code into classes for better organization
- [x] Make text scraping operations async for consistency
- [x] Add configurable concurrency via CLI
- [x] Add RAG processing capability for LLM training data
- [x] Enhance RAG processing with PDF text extraction
- [x] Add URL filtering with regex patterns for inclusion/exclusion
- [x] Implement rotating user agents for better stealth
- [x] Create a utility module for shared functions
- [x] Add progress reporting with tqdm
- [x] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [x] Add proper type hints throughout codebase
- [x] Create standalone PDF extraction tool
- [x] Add metadata extraction for saved content

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### High Priority
- [ ] Add proxy support for avoiding IP blocks
  - Implement proxy rotation logic in `utils.py`
  - Add proxy configuration options to main CLI
  - Create a proxy health check system
  
- [ ] Expand test suite
  - [x] Create basic end-to-end test script
  - [ ] Add unit tests for each module
  - [ ] Create integration tests with mock web servers
  - [ ] Implement CI workflow for automated testing

- [x] Enhance domain restriction functionality
  - [x] Add detailed logging for domain filtering
  - [x] Implement safety checks for domain leakage
  - [x] Improve link filtering statistics

- [ ] Improve error handling and resilience
  - Add domain-specific backoff strategies
  - Implement rate limiting per domain
  - Add automatic recovery for zombie browser processes

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add vector embedding generation for RAG data
  - Support multiple embedding models (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
  - Add vector storage options (FAISS, ChromaDB)
  - Create retrieval examples and utility functions

- [ ] Create configuration file system
  - Support YAML/JSON configurations
  - Add environment variable integration
  - Create configuration validation system

### Low Priority 
- [x] Add crawl depth control
  - [x] Implement depth-limited crawling
  - [x] Add breadth-first crawl strategy
  - [ ] Add site map generation
  - [ ] Create domain allowlist/blocklist system

- [ ] Improve memory management
  - [x] Implement streaming processing for large files (2.26x speedup in testing)
  - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
  - [ ] Create resource usage dashboards

- [ ] Enhance CLI experience
  - [x] Improve progress visualization with nested progress bars
  - [x] Add better start/end summaries
